### 5 Common Lease Renewal Mistakes That Cost Landlords Money
**Category**: Tips & Best Practices

Lease renewals seem straightforward, but these mistakes can cost thousands:

**Mistake #1: Automatic Renewal Clauses**
- **The Problem**: Tenant stays month-to-month at same rate
- **Why It Hurts**: Miss opportunity for rent increase
- **Market Impact**: $100-300/month = $1,200-3,600/year
- **Solution**: Require active renewal with updated terms

**Mistake #2: Late Rent Increase Notices**
- **The Problem**: Missing state-required notice periods
- **Typical Requirements**: 30-120 days depending on state
- **Consequence**: Cannot implement increase on time
- **Lost Revenue**: 1-4 months of increase = $200-1,200+
- **Solution**: Set calendar reminders 120 days before renewal

**Mistake #3: Below-Market Renewals**
- **The Problem**: Keeping "good tenants" at old rates
- **The Math**: 3% annual increase vs. 8% market rate = 5% loss
- **Example**: $2,000/month × 5% = $100/month = $1,200/year
- **5-Year Impact**: $6,000-8,000 in lost revenue
- **Solution**: Research comparable rents annually

**Mistake #4: Verbal Renewal Agreements**
- **The Problem**: No written documentation
- **Legal Risk**: Disputes over terms, rent amount, duration
- **Enforcement**: Difficult to prove or enforce terms
- **Solution**: Always use written renewal addendum

**Mistake #5: Not Updating Lease Terms**
- **The Problem**: Outdated rules, fees, policies
- **Common Issues**:
  - Old late fee amounts (haven't increased with rent)
  - Obsolete pet policies
  - Outdated maintenance procedures
  - Missing new legal requirements
- **Solution**: Review and update all terms at renewal

**Bonus Mistake: Ignoring Lease Expiration**
- **The Problem**: Discovering lease expired weeks ago
- **Auto Month-to-Month**: Harder to terminate, rent increase
- **Lost Control**: Tenant can leave with 30 days notice
- **Solution**: Track lease dates in calendar system

**Renewal Best Practices**:
1. **120 Days Out**: Research market rents
2. **90 Days Out**: Decide on renewal terms
3. **60-75 Days Out**: Send renewal offer letter
4. **45 Days Out**: Follow up if no response
5. **30 Days Out**: Finalize new lease or prepare for vacancy

**Renewal Offer Letter Should Include**:
- New rent amount with justification
- Lease term options (6, 12, 18, 24 months)
- Updated terms and conditions
- Deadline for decision (usually 30 days)
- Consequences of not renewing

**LeaseLenses Advantage**: 
- Automatic reminders 120 days before expiration

## 6. Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The Missing Clause That Cost $12,000

**Background**:
- Small landlord in California
- 4-unit apartment building
- Tenant wanted to break lease early
- Lease had no early termination clause

**The Problem**:
- Tenant left after 8 months of 12-month lease
- Landlord expected remaining 4 months rent ($12,000)
- Tenant refused, citing hardship
- No lease clause addressing early termination

**Legal Outcome**:
- California requires "reasonable effort" to re-rent
- Landlord couldn't keep full amount
- Had to advertise and show unit
- Could only charge actual vacancy period (2 months)
- Legal fees: $3,500
- Total loss: ~$5,500 in expected rent + legal fees

**How LeaseLenses Would Have Helped**:
- Flagged missing early termination clause
- Suggested standard California language
- Recommended re-renting fee structure
- Could have recovered $8,000 more

### Case Study 2: Pet Deposit Compliance Error

**Background**:
- Landlord in Connecticut
- Charged separate pet deposit ($500)
- Also had security deposit (2 months rent = $4,000)
- Total deposits: $4,500

**The Problem**:
- Connecticut limits total deposits to 2 months rent
- Pet deposits count toward limit
- Was over limit by $500
- Tenant discovered during dispute

**Legal Outcome**:
- Had to return excess $500
- Tenant sued for bad faith
- Court awarded 2x deposit ($9,000)
- Legal fees: $5,000
- Total cost: $14,000

**How LeaseLenses Would Have Helped**:
- AI would have flagged deposit total exceeding state limit
- Recommended combining deposits
- Could have structured as pet fee instead
- Saved $14,000

### Case Study 3: The Renewal Timing Disaster

**Background**:
- Property manager in Oregon
- 25-unit building
- Failed to track lease expirations
- Discovered issue 15 days before expiration

**The Problem**:
- Oregon requires 90-day notice for rent increases over 10%
- Market rents had increased 15%
- Only 15 days left to give notice
- Missed deadline

**Financial Impact**:
- Could only increase 9.9% (no 90-day notice)
- Lost 5.1% on 25 units
- Average rent: $1,800
- Lost revenue: $1,800 × 25 × 5.1% × 12 months = $27,540/year

**How LeaseLenses Would Have Helped**:
- Automatic 120-day advance reminders
- Tracked all 25 lease dates
