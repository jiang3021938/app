# New Hampshire Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![New Hampshire Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/new-hampshire-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Understanding **New Hampshire landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Granite State. Whether you own rental units in Manchester, manage properties in Nashua, or are a tenant in Concord, knowing the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

New Hampshire's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by **RSA 540** (Actions Against Tenants) and **RSA 540-A** (Prohibited Practices) along with **RSA 540-B** (Security Deposits). Together, these statutes establish the core rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants throughout the state.

This guide covers the most important aspects of New Hampshire landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. Whether you're a tenant seeking to understand your rights or a landlord working to maintain compliance, this article is your essential resource.

## Overview of New Hampshire's Landlord-Tenant Statutes

New Hampshire's landlord-tenant law is found in several chapters of the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated (RSA). The key statutes include RSA 540 (eviction procedures), RSA 540-A (prohibited landlord and tenant practices), and RSA 540-B (security deposits). Additional protections are found in RSA 48-A (housing standards).

### Key Principles

New Hampshire landlord-tenant law establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and habitable
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith throughout the tenancy
*   Lease agreements cannot waive the protections provided by law
*   Retaliatory actions by landlords are prohibited

## New Hampshire Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. New Hampshire's security deposit rules are outlined in RSA 540-B.

### Security Deposit Limit: 1 Month's Rent or $100, Whichever Is Greater

Under RSA 540-B:3, New Hampshire landlords may charge a security deposit of up to **one month's rent or $100, whichever is greater**. This is a hard cap that applies statewide.

For example, if the monthly rent is $1,500, the maximum security deposit is $1,500. If the monthly rent is $75 (rare, but possible for some situations), the minimum security deposit allowed would be $100.

### The 30-Day Return Rule

Under RSA 540-B:10, landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the rental agreement terminates. If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with a written **itemized statement** of deductions within the same 30-day period.

The 30-day period begins when:

*   The tenant surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   All keys are returned to the landlord
*   The rental agreement has terminated

The landlord must mail the deposit and statement to the tenant's last known address or forwarding address.

### Holding the Deposit

Under RSA 540-B:5, landlords must hold security deposits in a bank account in the state of New Hampshire or in a bank having a branch in New Hampshire. The deposit must be held in a separate account designated specifically for security deposits, or the landlord must post a bond in the amount of the deposit with the clerk of the local municipality.

### Permitted Deductions

New Hampshire landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Cleaning costs** — To restore the unit to the condition at move-in, beyond normal wear and tear
4.  **Unpaid utility charges** — If the tenant is responsible for utilities under the lease
5.  **Other lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches

Normal wear and tear — such as minor wall scuffs, small nail holes, gently worn carpet, and faded paint — cannot be deducted. Thorough documentation at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists is essential.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 30 days, the tenant may recover the full deposit amount. Under RSA 540-B:10, a landlord who wrongfully withholds a deposit may be liable for the amount wrongfully withheld plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The landlord's failure to comply with the deposit holding requirements may also result in forfeiture of the right to retain any portion of the deposit.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in New Hampshire

One of the most fundamental tenant protections under New Hampshire law is the right to a safe, habitable dwelling. RSA 48-A and RSA 540-A:2 outline the landlord's maintenance obligations.

### Landlord Obligations Under RSA 48-A and RSA 540-A:2

New Hampshire landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, and other systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Provide adequate heat during the heating season
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal where applicable
*   Maintain appliances supplied or required by the lease agreement
*   Provide functioning smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors

### Tenant Maintenance Responsibilities

New Hampshire tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, or damage the property
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Allow the landlord reasonable access for repairs and inspections

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving written notice, tenants have several remedies under New Hampshire law:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

Tenants must first provide written notice to the landlord describing the condition that requires repair. The landlord generally has **14 days** to remedy non-emergency conditions.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

Under New Hampshire common law and RSA 540-A, if the landlord fails to make essential repairs after proper notice, a tenant may contract for repairs and deduct the reasonable cost from rent. The tenant should provide written notice and allow a reasonable period for the landlord to act before exercising this remedy.

#### 3. Rent Escrow

If the landlord's failure to maintain habitability materially affects health and safety, a tenant may pay rent into an escrow account held by the court until the repairs are completed.

#### 4. Lease Termination

If the landlord fails to remedy a material health or safety violation within a reasonable timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement with proper written notice.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief. Tenants may also file complaints with the local housing or building code enforcement authority.

## Entry Rights: When Can New Hampshire Landlords Enter?

New Hampshire law balances the landlord's need to access the property with the tenant's right to privacy and quiet enjoyment.

### Reasonable Notice Requirement

Under RSA 540-A:3, landlords must provide **reasonable notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. While the statute does not specify an exact number of hours, the generally accepted practice is to provide at least **24 hours' notice** before entry. Entry must occur at reasonable times.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services
*   Other purposes permitted by the lease agreement

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as:

*   Fire or imminent danger to persons or property
*   Burst pipes, gas leaks, or other urgent maintenance issues
*   Reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the premises

If a landlord repeatedly enters without proper notice, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief and may recover damages.

## Eviction Process in New Hampshire

New Hampshire's eviction procedures are governed by RSA 540 (Actions Against Tenants). Landlords must follow these procedures precisely — failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

New Hampshire landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Failure to vacate at lease end** — Remaining after the lease term expires
3.  **Substantial damage to the property** — Willful or negligent destruction
4.  **Behavior that affects health and safety** — Conduct that poses a risk to other tenants
5.  **Other good cause** — As defined under RSA 540:2, including material lease violations

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper written notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **7-day demand for rent**, followed by a **30-day notice to quit** if rent is not paid (RSA 540:2-5)
*   **Lease violation / other good cause**: **30-day notice to quit** (RSA 540:3)
*   **Criminal conduct / significant damage**: **7-day notice to quit** (RSA 540:2, II(d))
*   **Lease expiration (no renewal)**: **30-day notice to quit** (RSA 540:3)
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** (RSA 540:3)
*   **Tenancy at will**: **30-day notice to quit**

### The Eviction Court Process (Possessory Action)

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the landlord can file a possessory action:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a landlord-tenant writ with the district court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the writ of summons at least **7 days** before the hearing
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing
4.  **Trial**: Both parties present evidence; tenants may raise defenses including retaliation and habitability violations
5.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Possession**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of possession, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Prohibited

New Hampshire law strictly prohibits self-help evictions under RSA 540-A:3. Landlords cannot:

*   Change or remove locks
*   Shut off utilities (heat, water, electricity, gas)
*   Remove doors or windows
*   Remove tenant belongings without a court order

Violations are considered "prohibited practices" under RSA 540-A and can result in liability for actual damages, statutory damages, and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Retaliation Protections Under RSA 540-A:4

RSA 540-A:4 protects tenants from retaliatory actions. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in retaliation for a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right under the law
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association
*   Reporting a violation of RSA 540-A

If retaliatory conduct occurs within **six months** of a protected activity, it is presumed retaliatory. The landlord bears the burden of proving a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the action.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in New Hampshire

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Neither party is required to give notice of non-renewal unless the lease specifies otherwise. However, the landlord must still provide a **30-day notice to quit** before commencing eviction proceedings even after lease expiration. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement on the same terms.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before the end of a rental period under RSA 540:3.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or habitability obligations
*   Domestic violence situations (with proper documentation and a protective order)
*   Unit becomes uninhabitable due to casualty damage

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. New Hampshire landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
