# 10 Common Lease Agreement Mistakes Landlords Make (And How to Avoid Them)

A single oversight in your lease agreement can cost you thousands of dollars in legal fees, lost rent, or regulatory fines. Yet many landlords — especially those managing smaller portfolios of 2 to 20 properties — continue to rely on outdated templates, skip critical disclosures, or overlook state-specific requirements that change every year.

This guide breaks down the **10 most common lease agreement mistakes** landlords make and, more importantly, shows you exactly how to fix them. Whether you manage properties in one state or across several, these insights will help you write stronger contracts, reduce legal exposure, and keep your rental business running smoothly.

## Mistake #1: Using a Generic, One-Size-Fits-All Lease Template

One of the biggest errors landlords make is downloading a free lease template online and using it without modification. Generic templates rarely account for the specific landlord-tenant laws in your state, and they almost never include the disclosures and clauses that local regulations require.

For example, a lease that works in Texas won't comply with California's strict rent control rules under AB 1482, and a template drafted for New York won't address Florida's unique security deposit handling requirements. Each state has its own framework, and your lease must reflect that.

**How to avoid it:** Always customize your lease for the state where your property is located. Review state-specific guides — such as our [Texas Landlord Tenant Law guide](/blog/texas-landlord-tenant-law-guide) or the [California Security Deposit Law 2026 guide](/blog/california-security-deposit-law-2026) — to understand what your lease must include. Better yet, use an [AI-powered lease review tool](/blog/review-lease-5-minutes) to automatically flag missing clauses and non-compliant terms.

## Mistake #2: Ignoring Security Deposit Rules

Security deposit disputes are the number one cause of landlord-tenant litigation in the United States. Every state sets its own rules on how much you can collect, where the deposit must be held, and how quickly you must return it after move-out.

Common violations include charging more than the state-allowed maximum, failing to provide an itemized deduction list, and missing the return deadline. In some states, these violations carry penalties of two to three times the deposit amount.

**How to avoid it:** Know the rules for your state before setting deposit terms. Our comprehensive [Security Deposit Laws by State guide](/blog/security-deposit-laws) covers all 50 states. You can also use our free [Security Deposit Calculator](/tools/security-deposit-calculator) to instantly check the legal maximum and return timeline for any state.

## Mistake #3: Missing Required Landlord Disclosures

Federal and state laws require landlords to disclose specific information before or at the time of signing a lease. The most well-known federal requirement is the lead-based paint disclosure for properties built before 1978, but many states add their own mandatory disclosures — including mold, flooding history, sex offender registries, and even the landlord's contact information.

Failing to provide a required disclosure doesn't just create legal risk; in some jurisdictions it can void portions of your lease entirely, making it unenforceable when you need it most.

**How to avoid it:** Review all [essential landlord disclosure requirements](/blog/landlord-disclosure-requirements-guide) for your property's location. Make sure every required disclosure is either included in your lease or provided as a signed addendum. AI lease analysis tools like LeaseLens can automatically detect missing disclosures and alert you before signing.

## Mistake #4: Setting Illegal Late Fees

Many landlords include late fee clauses in their leases without checking whether the amount complies with state law. Some states cap late fees at a specific dollar amount or percentage of rent, while others require that late fees be "reasonable" — a standard that courts interpret differently depending on the jurisdiction.

An illegal late fee clause is not only unenforceable; it can also expose you to counterclaims from tenants who challenge the fee in court, turning a simple collections matter into a costly legal battle.

**How to avoid it:** Check your state's rules before setting a late fee. Our free [Late Fee Checker](/tools/late-fee-checker) lets you verify whether your late fee complies with local law in seconds. For states with complex regulations, review the relevant state guide — for example, the [Illinois Eviction Notice Requirements guide](/blog/illinois-eviction-notice-requirements) covers notice and fee rules specific to Illinois.

## Mistake #5: Vague or Missing Rent Increase Provisions

If your lease doesn't clearly explain how, when, and by how much rent can be increased, you may find yourself unable to raise rent legally — or facing a tenant who disputes your increase notice. In rent-controlled jurisdictions like New York and California, the stakes are even higher: exceeding the allowable increase can trigger penalties and void the increase entirely.

**How to avoid it:** Include explicit rent increase language in every lease, specifying the notice period, the method of delivery, and any caps that apply. For properties in rent-controlled areas, consult our [New York Rent Control Laws guide](/blog/new-york-rent-control-laws-guide) or the [Colorado Tenant Rights 2026 guide](/blog/colorado-tenant-rights-2026). You can also use our free [Rent Increase Calculator](/tools/rent-increase-calculator) to determine the maximum legal increase for your property, and our [Rent Increase Notice Generator](/blog/rent-increase-notice-generator-free) to create a compliant notice in minutes.

## Mistake #6: Not Addressing Maintenance Responsibilities Clearly

Disputes over who is responsible for repairs are among the most common landlord-tenant conflicts. If your lease doesn't clearly delineate maintenance responsibilities — who handles minor repairs, pest control, appliance servicing, and common-area upkeep — you're inviting disagreements and potential legal action.

Every state imposes an implied warranty of habitability, which means landlords must maintain livable conditions regardless of what the lease says. But the line between "landlord obligation" and "tenant responsibility" varies by state and by lease terms.

**How to avoid it:** Draft a detailed maintenance clause that specifies exactly which repairs are the landlord's responsibility and which fall to the tenant. Reference your state's habitability standards — our state-specific guides like the [Georgia Landlord Tenant Law guide](/blog/georgia-landlord-tenant-law-guide) and the [Oregon Landlord Tenant Law guide](/blog/oregon-landlord-tenant-law-guide) outline these requirements in detail.

## Mistake #7: Improper Entry and Notice Provisions

Entering a tenant's unit without proper notice is one of the fastest ways to create legal trouble. Most states require landlords to provide written notice (commonly 24 to 48 hours) before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Leases that fail to include entry provisions — or that include provisions contradicting state law — leave landlords vulnerable to harassment claims and statutory penalties.

**How to avoid it:** Include a clear entry-notice clause in your lease that matches or exceeds your state's minimum requirements. Check our [Virginia Tenant Rights 2026 guide](/blog/virginia-tenant-rights-2026) or [Arizona Tenant Rights 2026 guide](/blog/arizona-tenant-rights-2026) for state-specific entry notice rules. Never include a clause that waives the tenant's right to notice — courts will not enforce it.

## Mistake #8: Weak or Non-Compliant Termination and Eviction Clauses

When it's time to end a tenancy — whether due to lease expiration, non-payment, or a lease violation — your lease must clearly state the process. Many landlords either omit termination procedures entirely or include language that conflicts with their state's eviction laws, resulting in delayed proceedings or dismissed cases.

Each state has specific rules about how much notice is required, what form the notice must take, and what grounds are legally sufficient for eviction. A lease that doesn't align with these rules gives tenants grounds to challenge the process.

**How to avoid it:** Draft termination and eviction clauses that precisely mirror your state's statutory requirements. Our [Indiana Eviction Process guide](/blog/indiana-eviction-process-guide) and [Michigan Eviction Process guide](/blog/michigan-eviction-process-guide) provide detailed breakdowns of the steps required in those states. For generating compliant notices quickly, use our free [Lease Termination Notice Generator](/tools/lease-termination-notice-generator).

## Mistake #9: Failing to Include a Lead-Based Paint Disclosure (Pre-1978 Properties)

This federal requirement is so critical — and so commonly violated — that it deserves its own section. For any residential property built before 1978, landlords must provide the EPA's lead-based paint pamphlet, disclose known lead hazards, and include a specific "Lead Warning Statement" in the lease. Tenants must also be given 10 days to conduct an inspection.

Penalties for non-compliance are severe: up to $19,507 per violation under current federal guidelines. Yet many landlords, particularly those managing older properties, either forget to include the disclosure or use an outdated version of the pamphlet.

**How to avoid it:** If your property was built before 1978, always include the lead disclosure as a signed lease addendum. Use AI-powered tools like LeaseLens to automatically verify that your lease includes the required lead paint language. Our [Pennsylvania Lease Agreement guide](/blog/pennsylvania-lease-agreement-guide) and [Massachusetts Landlord Tenant Law guide](/blog/massachusetts-landlord-tenant-law-guide) cover additional state-level requirements that go beyond the federal minimum.

## Mistake #10: Not Reviewing Your Lease Regularly

Laws change, court decisions create new precedents, and your lease can become non-compliant over time even if it was perfectly drafted when first created. California's security deposit cap dropped from two months' rent to one month in 2024 under AB 12. Colorado enacted new tenant protection laws effective in 2025. Relying on a lease you wrote years ago without regular review is a ticking time bomb.

**How to avoid it:** Review and update your lease at least once a year, ideally before each new lease signing or renewal. AI-powered tools make this fast and affordable — you can [review a lease in under 5 minutes using AI](/blog/review-lease-5-minutes), getting instant compliance checks and risk flags without spending hours on manual review. LeaseLens offers per-document analysis for just $9, or unlimited reviews at $29 per month — far less than the cost of a single legal dispute.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the most common lease agreement mistake landlords make?
The most common mistake is using a generic lease template that doesn't comply with state-specific landlord-tenant laws. Every state has different requirements for security deposits, disclosures, entry notice, and eviction procedures, and a one-size-fits-all lease rarely meets all of them.

### How often should I review and update my lease agreement?
At minimum, review your lease annually. Laws change frequently — for example, California's security deposit cap changed in 2024, and multiple states enacted new tenant protections in 2025. An annual review ensures your lease stays compliant with current regulations.

### Can AI tools really catch lease agreement errors?
Yes. Modern AI lease analysis tools like LeaseLens use natural language processing to extract key terms, identify missing clauses, and check for state-specific compliance. They can flag issues like illegal late fees, missing disclosures, and non-compliant termination clauses in seconds — tasks that would take a human reviewer hours to complete manually.

### What happens if my lease is missing a required disclosure?
Consequences vary by state, but missing disclosures can result in fines, voided lease clauses, liability for tenant damages, and in some cases, penalties of two to three times the security deposit amount. Federal lead paint disclosure violations carry fines up to $19,507 per violation.

### Is it worth paying for professional lease review?
For most small landlords, AI-powered lease review offers the best balance of cost and thoroughness. At $9 per document or $29 per month for unlimited reviews, tools like LeaseLens cost a fraction of what an attorney charges while catching the most common compliance issues instantly. For complex situations, the AI report also serves as an excellent starting point for a targeted attorney consultation.
