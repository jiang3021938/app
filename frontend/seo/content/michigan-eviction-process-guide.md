# Michigan Eviction Process 2026: Steps, Timelines & Legal Requirements

![Michigan Eviction Process Guide 2026](/assets/michigan-eviction-process-guide-hero.webp)

Evicting a tenant is never a pleasant experience, but sometimes it's necessary to protect your property and business interests. In Michigan, the eviction process is governed by the state's Truth in Renting Act (Michigan Compiled Laws §554.601-616) and summary proceedings statutes (MCL §600.5701 et seq.). Understanding and following these legal requirements is crucial—mistakes can delay evictions by weeks or months and potentially expose you to legal liability.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the complete Michigan eviction process in 2026, including required notices, timelines, court procedures, and common pitfalls to avoid. Whether you're dealing with non-payment of rent, lease violations, or holdover tenants, this guide provides the information you need to navigate Michigan's eviction laws successfully.

By the end of this article, you'll understand exactly how to properly execute an eviction in Michigan while staying compliant with state law and protecting your rights as a landlord. Let's begin with the legal framework that governs Michigan evictions.

## Understanding Michigan's Eviction Legal Framework

Michigan's eviction process is primarily governed by two key statutes:

### Truth in Renting Act (MCL §554.601-616)

This Act establishes fundamental rights and responsibilities for both landlords and tenants, including:
- Security deposit requirements (maximum 1.5 months' rent)
- Required notices and disclosures
- Habitability standards
- Termination procedures

The Truth in Renting Act requires landlords to provide tenants with specific information about their rights, typically at the beginning of the tenancy.

### Summary Proceedings (MCL §600.5701 et seq.)

These statutes govern the actual eviction process, including:
- Grounds for eviction
- Notice requirements
- Court filing procedures
- Judgment and enforcement

Michigan's summary proceeding process is designed to be relatively fast compared to regular civil litigation, but it still requires strict adherence to procedural rules.

## Valid Grounds for Eviction in Michigan

Before initiating an eviction, ensure you have legal grounds. Michigan allows evictions for several reasons:

### 1. Non-Payment of Rent

The most common reason for eviction. If a tenant fails to pay rent when due, you can begin eviction proceedings after providing proper notice.

### 2. Lease Violations

Breaches of the lease agreement, such as:
- Unauthorized pets
- Unapproved subletting or occupants
- Excessive noise or disturbances
- Property damage
- Illegal activities on the premises
- Violating house rules

### 3. End of Lease Term (Holdover Tenancy)

When a fixed-term lease expires and the tenant remains without signing a new lease or converting to month-to-month.

### 4. No-Cause Termination (Month-to-Month Tenancies)

For month-to-month leases, landlords can terminate without stating a reason, provided they give proper notice.

### 5. Health and Safety Violations

Serious violations that threaten the health or safety of other tenants or the property.

**Important**: You cannot evict a tenant for discriminatory reasons (race, religion, national origin, sex, disability, familial status) or in retaliation for exercising their legal rights (such as reporting housing code violations).

## Required Notice Periods and Types

Michigan law requires landlords to provide specific written notices before filing for eviction. The type and duration of notice depend on the reason for eviction.

### 7-Day Notice to Quit (Non-Payment of Rent)

For non-payment of rent, Michigan requires a **7-day Notice to Quit**:

**Requirements**:
- Must be in writing
- State the amount of rent owed
- Demand payment within 7 days
- Inform tenant that failure to pay will result in eviction proceedings
- Be served properly (see service methods below)

The 7-day period begins the day after the notice is served. If the tenant pays all rent owed plus any late fees specified in the lease within the 7-day period, the eviction process stops.

**Important**: The notice must demand the full amount owed. You cannot accept partial payment and then proceed with eviction for the remaining balance unless the notice specifically stated you would accept partial payment.

### 30-Day Notice to Quit (Lease Violations)

For lease violations other than non-payment, landlords must provide a **30-day Notice to Quit**:

**Requirements**:
- Must be in writing
- Specify the lease violation with enough detail for the tenant to understand
- State that the tenant has 30 days to vacate
- Reference the lease clause being violated
- Be served properly

Unlike non-payment notices, lease violation notices typically don't offer the tenant an opportunity to cure the violation—the notice simply requires them to vacate within 30 days.

However, some landlords choose to provide a shorter notice to cure (e.g., "Cure this violation within 7 days or vacate within 30 days"), though Michigan law doesn't require this except for specific situations like health and safety issues.

### 30-Day Notice (Month-to-Month Termination)

To end a month-to-month tenancy without cause:

**Requirements**:
- Must be in writing
- Provide 30 days notice
- Notice period typically ends on the last day of a rental period
- Be served properly

**Example**: If rent is due on the 1st of each month and you serve notice on January 15, the tenant must vacate by February 28 (or 29), not February 15.

### Immediate Notice (Health and Safety Violations)

For severe health and safety violations (illegal drug activity, significant property damage, violent threats), Michigan courts may allow shorter notice periods or immediate eviction proceedings. Consult with an attorney for these serious situations.

## Proper Service of Eviction Notices

How you serve the eviction notice is just as important as the notice itself. Improper service can invalidate your notice and restart the timeline.

### Acceptable Service Methods in Michigan

1. **Personal Service**: Hand the notice directly to the tenant (most reliable method)

2. **Substituted Service**: If the tenant is absent, you can leave the notice with someone of suitable age (typically 18+) at the tenant's residence and mail a copy to the tenant

3. **Posting and Mailing**: If personal service fails after reasonable attempts, you can post the notice in a conspicuous place (like the front door) and mail a copy via first-class mail

4. **Certified Mail**: While not required for initial notices, certified mail with return receipt provides excellent proof of service

**Documentation**: Always document how and when you served the notice:
- Take photos of posted notices with timestamps
- Keep signed receipts if hand-delivered
- Retain mailing receipts and certified mail return cards
- Note who you delivered to and when

Proper documentation is essential if the tenant challenges your service in court.

## The Court Eviction Process: Step-by-Step

If the tenant doesn't comply with your notice (pay rent or vacate), you can proceed to court.

### Step 1: File a Summons and Complaint

File your eviction case (called "summary proceeding" in Michigan) in the **district court** where the property is located.

**Required documents**:
- **Summons**: Court form notifying the tenant of the lawsuit
- **Complaint**: Your statement of why you're seeking eviction
- **Lease agreement**: Copy of the signed lease
- **Notice(s)**: Copies of all notices served to the tenant
- **Filing fee**: Typically $45-$75 depending on the county

The complaint must include:
- Names of all parties
- Property address
- Grounds for eviction
- Dates of notices served
- Amount of rent owed (if applicable)
- Request for possession of the property

### Step 2: Tenant is Served with Summons

After filing, the court will serve the tenant with the summons and complaint. Service methods include:

- Personal service by court officer or process server
- Posting and mailing (if personal service fails)

The tenant must receive the summons at least **10 days before the hearing** for non-payment cases and other summary proceedings.

### Step 3: Tenant's Response Options

Once served, the tenant has several options:

**For Non-Payment Cases**:
- **Pay in full**: Pay all rent, late fees, and court costs (called "redemption") up until the judge issues a judgment. This ends the eviction.
- **File an answer**: Respond to the complaint, potentially raising defenses
- **Request adjournment**: Ask for more time (typically 10 days)
- **Do nothing**: Results in default judgment for the landlord

**For Other Cases**:
- **File an answer**: Dispute the allegations
- **Negotiate**: Try to settle with the landlord
- **Do nothing**: Default judgment for the landlord

### Step 4: Court Hearing

If the tenant files an answer or contests the eviction, the court will schedule a hearing.

**What to bring**:
- Original lease agreement
- All notices with proof of service
- Payment records showing non-payment (ledger, bank statements)
- Photos of property damage (if relevant)
- Correspondence with tenant
- Witness testimony (if needed)

**At the hearing**:
- Present your case clearly and factually
- Provide evidence supporting your claim
- Answer the judge's questions honestly
- Remain professional and respectful

The judge will determine whether:
1. Proper notice was given
2. Grounds for eviction exist
3. The landlord followed all legal procedures

### Step 5: Judgment and Writ of Restitution

If the judge rules in your favor:

**Judgment of Possession**: The court issues a judgment granting you possession of the property.

**10-Day Stay**: The tenant typically receives **10 days** from the judgment date to vacate voluntarily. This period allows them to move out without forcible removal.

**Writ of Restitution**: After the 10-day period, if the tenant hasn't vacated, you can request a **Writ of Restitution** from the court (usually a small additional fee).

The writ authorizes the **court officer (bailiff)** to physically remove the tenant and their belongings from the property. The bailiff will schedule an eviction date, typically giving the tenant a few days' notice.

### Step 6: Physical Eviction (If Necessary)

On the scheduled eviction date:

- The bailiff arrives at the property
- The tenant must leave or be forcibly removed
- Belongings are removed and placed at the curb or in storage (depending on local procedures)
- You receive possession of the property

**Never attempt to remove a tenant yourself**—only court officers can physically evict tenants. Self-help evictions are illegal and can result in significant liability.

## Timeline: How Long Does Michigan Eviction Take?

Understanding typical timelines helps you plan appropriately.

### Non-Payment of Rent Timeline

- **Day 1-7**: 7-day notice period
- **Day 8**: File court summons and complaint
- **Day 18-20**: Court hearing (10+ days after service)
- **Day 28-30**: 10-day post-judgment stay
- **Day 35-40**: Physical eviction (if necessary)

**Total: 5-6 weeks** from initial notice to physical removal

### Lease Violation Timeline

- **Day 1-30**: 30-day notice period
- **Day 31**: File court summons and complaint
- **Day 41-43**: Court hearing (10+ days after service)
- **Day 51-53**: 10-day post-judgment stay
- **Day 56-60**: Physical eviction (if necessary)

**Total: 8-9 weeks** from initial notice to physical removal

### Factors That Can Extend Timelines

- **Tenant requests adjournment**: Adds 10+ days
- **Tenant files counterclaims**: Can significantly delay proceedings
- **Court backlog**: Busy courts may take longer to schedule hearings
- **Improper notice or service**: Restarts the entire process
- **Appeals**: Rare but can add weeks or months
- **Tenant redemption**: Tenant pays at the last moment, stopping the process

## What Landlords Cannot Do: Illegal Eviction Practices

Michigan law strictly prohibits "self-help" eviction tactics. You must use the court process.

### Prohibited Actions

**Never**:
- Change locks without a court order and writ
- Shut off utilities (water, electricity, heat, gas)
- Remove doors or windows
- Remove tenant's belongings without court authorization
- Physically intimidate or threaten tenants
- Enter the property without proper notice (except emergencies)
- Use force or threaten force to remove a tenant

### Consequences of Illegal Eviction

If you engage in illegal eviction practices, you may face:

- **Civil liability**: Tenant can sue for damages, including:
  - Actual damages (hotel costs, moving expenses, damaged property)
  - Punitive damages (3x actual damages in some cases)
  - Attorney's fees and court costs
- **Criminal charges**: Some actions may constitute criminal activity
- **Inability to collect rent**: Courts may rule you cannot collect rent for the illegal eviction period
- **Tenant's defense**: Illegal eviction can be a defense in your eviction case, causing dismissal

**Always follow the legal process**, even when dealing with difficult or destructive tenants.

## Collecting Unpaid Rent and Damages

Winning an eviction case doesn't automatically mean you'll collect unpaid rent or damages.

### Judgment for Possession vs. Money Judgment

An eviction proceeding primarily seeks **possession of the property**. While you can request a **money judgment** for unpaid rent and damages in the same proceeding, the court's primary focus is possession.

### Obtaining a Money Judgment

To collect unpaid rent and damages:

1. **Include in eviction complaint**: Request both possession and monetary damages
2. **Separate small claims case**: File a separate lawsuit for unpaid rent and damages (up to $6,500 in Michigan small claims court)
3. **District court case**: For larger amounts, file in district court

### Collecting on a Judgment

If the court awards you a money judgment:

- **Voluntary payment**: Tenant pays voluntarily (rare)
- **Wage garnishment**: Court orders employer to deduct from tenant's paycheck
- **Bank account levy**: Seize funds from tenant's bank accounts
- **Property liens**: Place liens on tenant's property
- **Credit reporting**: Report judgment to credit bureaus (damages tenant's credit)

Collection can be difficult and time-consuming, especially if the tenant has few assets. Consider whether pursuing collection is worth the effort and expense.

## Special Situations and Considerations

### Abandoned Property

If a tenant abandons the property:

- You still must follow eviction procedures to legally retake possession
- Do not assume abandonment—look for clear signs (utilities shut off, neighbors report seeing tenant move, belongings removed)
- Change locks only after legal eviction or clear abandonment
- Store abandoned belongings according to Michigan law (typically 7-28 days depending on value)

### Federal Housing Protections

Be aware of federal protections that may affect evictions:

**CARES Act** (for federally-backed properties): While many COVID-era protections have expired, some federal programs still have specific eviction procedures.

**Fair Housing Act**: Cannot evict based on protected characteristics (race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, disability).

**Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)**: Provides protections for domestic violence victims.

### Evicting with Subsidized Housing (Section 8)

For tenants with Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8):

- You must have "good cause" to evict
- Notify the housing authority of eviction proceedings
- Follow both state law and HUD regulations
- Coordinate with the housing authority throughout the process

### Winter Evictions

Michigan does not prohibit winter evictions, but some local ordinances may have restrictions. Always check local rules. Additionally, be aware that courts may be more lenient with tenants during harsh Michigan winters, especially if the eviction would leave them without shelter in dangerous cold.

## Common Mistakes Michigan Landlords Make

Avoid these frequent errors that can derail evictions:

### 1. Improper Notice

**Mistake**: Providing incorrect notice periods (5 days instead of 7, or 15 days instead of 30).

**Solution**: Always verify the correct notice period for your situation. Use templates that include required language.

### 2. Inadequate Service Documentation

**Mistake**: Failing to document how and when notice was served.

**Solution**: Take photos, keep receipts, use certified mail, and maintain detailed records.

### 3. Accepting Partial Payment After Notice

**Mistake**: Accepting rent after serving a 7-day notice, which may invalidate the notice.

**Solution**: If you accept payment after serving notice, you may need to start over. Be clear about your intentions.

### 4. Self-Help Eviction

**Mistake**: Changing locks or removing belongings without a court order.

**Solution**: Always go through the court process, no matter how frustrating or costly. The legal consequences of self-help eviction are severe.

### 5. Missing Required Information

**Mistake**: Leaving out key details in court filings (dates, amounts, addresses).

**Solution**: Double-check all documents for completeness and accuracy before filing.

### 6. Poor Court Preparation

**Mistake**: Arriving at court without proper documentation or evidence.

**Solution**: Bring originals and copies of all relevant documents. Organize them chronologically.

### 7. Retaliatory Eviction

**Mistake**: Evicting a tenant shortly after they complained about repairs or housing code violations.

**Solution**: Document legitimate reasons for eviction clearly. Avoid any appearance of retaliation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I evict a tenant without a written lease?**
A: Yes, Michigan allows evictions even without written leases (oral agreements or month-to-month tenancies). However, proving terms and violations is more difficult without written documentation, which is why written leases are strongly recommended.

**Q: What if the tenant pays rent after I file in court but before the hearing?**
A: For non-payment cases, Michigan law allows tenants to "redeem" by paying all rent, costs, and fees up until the judge issues a judgment. Once they pay, the eviction stops. If you've incurred court costs, these should be included in the redemption amount.

**Q: Can I charge the tenant for court costs and attorney's fees?**
A: You can request court costs in your complaint. Whether you can charge attorney's fees depends on your lease agreement—if it includes an attorney's fees clause, you can request them. Otherwise, each party typically pays their own legal fees.

**Q: How long do I have to store a tenant's belongings after eviction?**
A: Michigan law requires landlords to store abandoned property for reasonable periods depending on value. Generally, high-value items must be stored longer (up to 28 days) than low-value items (7 days). Check MCL §600.5714 for specific requirements.

**Q: What if the tenant files for bankruptcy?**
A: Bankruptcy can complicate evictions. An automatic stay typically stops eviction proceedings temporarily. However, you may be able to get relief from the bankruptcy court to proceed, especially for non-payment cases. Consult with an attorney if a tenant files bankruptcy.

**Q: Can I evict a tenant for having guests?**
A: You can evict for lease violations, including unauthorized occupants. However, you must distinguish between guests (temporary visitors) and unauthorized occupants (people living there). Your lease should define guest limits and duration.

## Conclusion: Navigating Michigan Evictions Successfully

Evicting a tenant in Michigan requires strict adherence to legal procedures established by the Truth in Renting Act and summary proceedings statutes. While the process can take 5-9 weeks or longer, following the proper steps protects you from legal liability and ensures successful outcomes.
