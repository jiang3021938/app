# Rhode Island Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Rhode Island Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/rhode-island-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Navigating **Rhode Island landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Ocean State. Whether you own rental units in Providence, manage properties in Warwick, or are a tenant in Cranston, understanding the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Rhode Island's primary residential landlord-tenant statute is the **Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (RLTA)**, codified in Rhode Island General Laws §34-18-1 through §34-18-57. This act applies to most residential rental agreements and provides the baseline rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants throughout the state.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of Rhode Island landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities under Rhode Island law.

## Overview of the Rhode Island Residential Landlord and Tenant Act

The RLTA, found in Rhode Island General Laws §34-18, establishes a comprehensive framework for residential rental relationships. It applies to most residential rental agreements in the state, with limited exceptions for transient occupancy in hotels and motels, residence at institutions, and certain other arrangements specified in §34-18-8.

### Key Principles

The Act establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and habitable
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith throughout the tenancy
*   Lease agreements cannot waive the protections provided by the Act
*   Retaliatory actions by landlords are prohibited

## Rhode Island Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Rhode Island's rules are outlined in Rhode Island General Laws §34-18-19.

### One Month's Rent Maximum

Under §34-18-19, **Rhode Island limits security deposits to one month's rent**. This is one of the more tenant-friendly deposit caps in the United States and applies to all residential rental agreements covered by the RLTA.

The one-month limit includes the security deposit itself and does not include the last month's rent if that is collected separately. Landlords may not collect additional refundable deposits beyond the one-month limit unless specifically permitted by another provision of law.

### The 20-Day Return Rule

Under Rhode Island General Laws §34-18-19(a), landlords must return the security deposit within **20 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the tenancy has terminated. This is one of the shortest return windows in the nation.

The 20-day period begins when the tenant:

*   Surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   Returns all keys to the landlord
*   The tenancy has been properly terminated

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with an **itemized written statement** detailing each deduction along with the remaining balance within the 20-day period.

### Permitted Deductions

Rhode Island landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Breach of lease terms** — Costs resulting from lease violations
4.  **Unpaid utilities** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, and fading paint — cannot be deducted. Document the condition of the unit thoroughly at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 20 days, the tenant may recover the full deposit amount. Under §34-18-19(b), if the landlord willfully fails to comply with the deposit return requirements, the tenant may also recover **double the amount wrongfully withheld**, plus reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Rhode Island

One of the most fundamental tenant protections under the RLTA is the right to a safe, habitable dwelling. Rhode Island General Laws §34-18-22 outlines the landlord's maintenance obligations.

### Landlord Obligations Under §34-18-22

Rhode Island landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water at all times
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal where applicable
*   Maintain appliances and facilities supplied or required to be supplied by the landlord
*   Supply adequate heating from September 15 to June 1 (where the landlord is responsible for heat)

### Tenant's Maintenance Responsibilities

Under Rhode Island General Laws §34-18-24, tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage, rubbish, and other waste in a clean and safe manner
*   Use electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, damage, impair, or remove any part of the premises
*   Comply with all applicable building and housing codes
*   Conduct themselves in a manner that does not disturb other tenants' peaceful enjoyment

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving written notice, tenants have several remedies under the RLTA:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is always to notify the landlord in writing. Under §34-18-30, the landlord generally has **20 days** to remedy a non-emergency condition after receiving written notice. For conditions affecting health and safety, the timeframe may be shorter.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

Under §34-18-30, if the landlord fails to make essential repairs within 20 days after written notice (or a shorter reasonable period for emergencies), the tenant may arrange for repairs and deduct the cost from rent. The tenant must follow specific procedures and provide documentation.

#### 3. Rent Escrow

Rhode Island tenants may petition the court to place rent in escrow if the landlord fails to maintain the premises in a habitable condition. The court will hold the rent until the landlord makes necessary repairs.

#### 4. Termination of Lease

If the landlord fails to address a material health or safety violation within the required timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement under §34-18-29. The tenant must provide written notice.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit against the landlord for breach of the habitability warranty, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can Rhode Island Landlords Enter?

Rhode Island law balances the landlord's need to access the property with the tenant's right to privacy.

### Notice Requirements Under §34-18-26

Under the RLTA, landlords must provide **two days' (48 hours') notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Entry must occur at reasonable times.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs, decorations, alterations, or improvements
*   Supplying necessary or agreed-upon services
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, lenders, or contractors
*   Other purposes agreed upon by both parties

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, gas leaks, burst pipes, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property. Landlords may also enter if they reasonably believe the tenant has abandoned the premises.

## Eviction Process in Rhode Island

Rhode Island's eviction procedures are governed by the RLTA and the Rhode Island Eviction Procedures Act (Rhode Island General Laws §34-18-34 through §34-18-46). Landlords must follow these procedures precisely; failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Rhode Island landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Breaches of significant lease terms
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on or near the premises
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
5.  **Health or safety violations** — Tenant actions that endanger the property or other tenants
6.  **Nuisance** — Behavior that constitutes a nuisance to other tenants or neighbors

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **5-day notice** to pay or quit, with the opportunity to cure by paying all rent owed within that period
*   **Material lease violation (first offense)**: **20-day notice** to remedy or vacate (§34-18-36(e))
*   **Repeated lease violations**: **20-day unconditional notice** to vacate if the same or similar violation occurs within six months of a prior notice (§34-18-36(f))
*   **Criminal activity or serious nuisance**: May be subject to expedited proceedings
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** (§34-18-37)

### The Eviction Court Process

If the tenant does not comply with the notice, the landlord can file an eviction action in district court:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a complaint for eviction with the district court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 7–20 days
4.  **Judgment**: The judge hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
5.  **Writ of Execution**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of execution, and the sheriff or constable can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

Rhode Island law strictly prohibits self-help evictions under §34-18-34. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant

Violations can result in liability for actual damages, plus up to **three months' periodic rent**, and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Retaliation Protections

Rhode Island General Laws §34-18-46 protects tenants from retaliatory actions by landlords. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in response to a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right granted by the RLTA
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association
*   Testifying against the landlord in a proceeding

If retaliatory action occurs within six months of a protected activity, the burden shifts to the landlord to prove the action was not retaliatory. The tenant may raise retaliation as a defense to eviction and may recover damages.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Rhode Island

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Neither party is required to give notice of non-renewal unless the lease specifies otherwise. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before termination under §34-18-37.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or the RLTA
*   Domestic violence situations (under Rhode Island General Laws §34-18-40.1)
*   Uninhabitable conditions that the landlord refuses to remedy
*   Tenant is a victim of sexual assault or stalking (with proper documentation and a protective order)

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Rhode Island landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
