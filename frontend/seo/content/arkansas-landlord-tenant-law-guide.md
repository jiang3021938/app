# Arkansas Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Arkansas Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/arkansas-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Understanding **Arkansas landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Natural State. Whether you own rental properties in Little Rock, manage units in Fayetteville, or are a tenant in Fort Smith, knowing the legal framework that governs rental relationships helps protect your rights and prevent costly disputes.

Arkansas's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed by **Arkansas Code §18-16-101 through §18-16-306** and related statutes. Unlike many states, Arkansas has historically been considered one of the more landlord-friendly states in the country, with fewer statutory protections for tenants compared to states with comprehensive landlord-tenant acts. However, there are still important rules that both parties must follow.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of Arkansas landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, repair obligations, and lease termination rules.

## Overview of Arkansas Landlord-Tenant Law

Arkansas's landlord-tenant framework is found primarily in Arkansas Code Title 18, Chapter 16. The state also has the **Arkansas Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 2007** (§18-17-101 et seq.), though its protections are more limited than similar acts in other states.

### Key Characteristics of Arkansas Law

Arkansas landlord-tenant law has several distinctive features:

*   **No implied warranty of habitability** in many cases — Arkansas is one of the few states that has historically not recognized a broad implied warranty of habitability in common law, though the 2007 Act provides some protections
*   **Criminal eviction provisions** — Arkansas is one of the few states where failure to vacate after proper notice can result in criminal charges under certain circumstances
*   **Landlord-friendly framework** — Many provisions favor property owners compared to other states
*   **Limited repair-and-deduct remedies** — Tenant self-help remedies are more restricted

Despite these characteristics, landlords still have significant obligations, and tenants retain important rights. Both parties benefit from understanding the law thoroughly.

## Arkansas Security Deposit Law

Security deposit rules in Arkansas are outlined in Arkansas Code §18-16-303 through §18-16-306.

### Security Deposit Limit: 2 Months' Rent Maximum

Under Arkansas Code §18-16-304, landlords may charge a security deposit of up to **two months' rent**. This cap applies to all refundable deposits collected at the start of the tenancy.

For example, if the monthly rent is $1,000, the maximum security deposit is $2,000. This includes any deposit labeled as a "pet deposit," "cleaning deposit," or similar, as long as it is refundable.

### The 60-Day Return Rule

Under Arkansas Code §18-16-305, landlords must return the security deposit within **60 days** after the tenant vacates the premises. If the landlord intends to make deductions, they must provide the tenant with an **itemized statement** describing each deduction along with the remaining balance.

The 60-day period begins when:

*   The tenant surrenders possession
*   The lease terminates, whichever is later

The landlord must mail the deposit and statement to the tenant's last known address or forwarding address.

### Permitted Deductions

Arkansas landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Cleaning costs** — To restore the unit to the condition at move-in (minus normal wear)
4.  **Other lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs, small nail holes, worn carpet from normal use, faded paint — cannot be deducted.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 60 days, the tenant may be entitled to recover the full deposit amount. Courts may also award the tenant reasonable attorney's fees in deposit disputes.

### Best Practices for Security Deposits

*   Conduct thorough move-in and move-out inspections with dated photos
*   Have the tenant sign a condition report at move-in
*   Keep deposits in a separate account (recommended, not statutorily required)
*   Return deposits and itemized statements promptly within the 60-day window
*   Keep copies of all receipts, invoices, and documentation for deductions

## Habitability and Repair Obligations in Arkansas

### The 2007 Arkansas Residential Landlord-Tenant Act

The Arkansas Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 2007 (§18-17-101 et seq.) provides certain habitability protections. Under this act, landlords who own rental property must:

*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes affecting health and safety
*   Make repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas in a clean and safe condition
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems in good working order
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water

### Tenant's Maintenance Responsibilities

Tenants in Arkansas must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage properly
*   Use fixtures, appliances, and systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently damage the property
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Report necessary repairs promptly to the landlord

### Repair Procedures

When repairs are needed:

1.  **Written Notice**: The tenant should provide written notice to the landlord describing the condition that requires repair
2.  **Landlord Response**: The landlord should acknowledge the request and begin repairs within a reasonable time
3.  **Emergency Repairs**: Conditions that pose an immediate threat to health or safety should be addressed immediately
4.  **Failure to Repair**: If the landlord fails to make necessary repairs within a reasonable time, the tenant may have limited remedies depending on the circumstances

Unlike many states, Arkansas does not provide a robust statutory repair-and-deduct remedy. Tenants should consult with an attorney before taking self-help measures.

### Important Note on Habitability

Tenants should be aware that Arkansas's habitability protections are more limited than those in many other states. The 2007 Act provides a framework, but enforcement mechanisms differ. For significant habitability issues, consulting with a local tenant advocacy organization or attorney is recommended.

## Entry Rights in Arkansas

### Notice Requirements

Arkansas does not have a specific statute mandating a minimum notice period for landlord entry. However, the lease agreement typically addresses entry rights, and common law principles of quiet enjoyment apply.

**Best practices recommend:**

*   Providing at least **24 hours' written notice** before entry
*   Entering only at reasonable times (typically 8 AM to 8 PM)
*   Specifying entry procedures in the lease agreement

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords generally may enter for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants or buyers
*   Emergencies posing imminent danger to persons or property

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, flood, gas leaks, or other situations involving imminent danger. Document any emergency entry with notes about the date, time, and circumstances.

## Eviction Process in Arkansas

Arkansas's eviction process is governed by Arkansas Code §18-16-101 through §18-16-112 and related statutes. The process is generally considered efficient compared to many other states.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Arkansas landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Significant breaches of the lease agreement
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
5.  **Failure to vacate after proper notice** — Refusing to leave after receiving valid termination notice

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: Under the standard lease provisions, landlords typically must provide a notice period before filing (often specified in the lease, commonly **3 to 10 days**)
*   **Lease violations**: Notice periods are typically governed by the lease agreement
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** under Arkansas Code §18-17-701
*   **Criminal activity or imminent danger**: Immediate or very short notice periods may apply

### The Unlawful Detainer Process

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the landlord files an unlawful detainer action:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files an unlawful detainer complaint with the district court
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing
4.  **Trial**: Both parties present evidence to the judge
5.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Possession**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of possession, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Criminal Failure to Vacate

Arkansas is one of the few states with a criminal failure-to-vacate statute (Arkansas Code §18-16-101). A tenant who fails to vacate after receiving a proper 10-day written notice to vacate may face criminal charges, including a fine of up to $25 per day. This provision is controversial and has faced legal challenges, but it remains on the books.

### Self-Help Evictions

While Arkansas law is less explicit than some states regarding self-help evictions, landlords should always use the court process. Taking matters into your own hands — changing locks, removing belongings, or shutting off utilities — can expose landlords to liability and is strongly discouraged.

## Retaliation Protections

Under the 2007 Arkansas Residential Landlord-Tenant Act (§18-17-806), landlords may not retaliate against tenants for:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any rights under the Act

Retaliatory actions — such as raising rent, decreasing services, or filing for eviction — taken within a reasonable time after protected activity may be challenged by the tenant.

## Lease Termination and Renewal

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires at the end of the stated term. If the tenant remains and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

Either party may terminate a month-to-month tenancy by providing at least **30 days' written notice** before the end of a rental period.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease
*   Domestic violence (Arkansas Code §18-16-112 provides some protections)
*   Uninhabitable conditions the landlord refuses to remedy

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early generally remain liable for rent until the unit is re-rented or the lease term expires. Landlords should make reasonable efforts to mitigate damages by re-renting.

### Rent Increases

Arkansas has no rent control laws. Landlords can set and increase rent freely, but must provide proper notice for month-to-month tenancies. Rent cannot be increased during a fixed-term lease unless the lease specifically allows it.
