# New Mexico Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![New Mexico Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/new-mexico-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Navigating **New Mexico landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Land of Enchantment. Whether you own rental units in Albuquerque, manage properties in Santa Fe, or are a tenant in Las Cruces, understanding the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

New Mexico's primary residential landlord-tenant statute is the **Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act (UORRA)**, codified in New Mexico Statutes §47-8-1 through §47-8-51. This act applies to most residential rental agreements and provides the baseline rights and obligations for both owners (landlords) and residents (tenants) throughout the state.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of New Mexico landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities under New Mexico law.

## Overview of the Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act

The UORRA, found in New Mexico Statutes §47-8, establishes a comprehensive framework for residential rental relationships. It applies to most residential rental agreements in the state, with limited exceptions for transient occupancy in hotels, residence at institutions, and certain owner-occupied arrangements.

### Key Principles

The Act establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Owners must provide rental units that are safe and habitable
*   Residents must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith throughout the tenancy
*   Lease agreements cannot waive the protections provided by the Act
*   Retaliatory actions by owners are prohibited

New Mexico uses the terms "owner" and "resident" rather than "landlord" and "tenant" in its statutes, though both terms are commonly used in practice.

## New Mexico Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. New Mexico's rules are outlined in New Mexico Statutes §47-8-18.

### One Month's Rent Maximum

Under §47-8-18, **New Mexico limits security deposits to one month's rent** for residential rental agreements with a term of less than one year. For leases of one year or longer, the deposit may not exceed an amount equal to one month's rent. This is one of the more tenant-friendly deposit caps in the United States.

The deposit limit includes all refundable deposits collected by the owner, including pet deposits and similar charges. Non-refundable fees, such as clearly designated non-refundable pet fees or administrative fees, are generally not counted toward this limit.

### The 30-Day Return Rule

Under New Mexico Statutes §47-8-18(D), owners must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the resident vacates the premises and provides a forwarding address. This 30-day window applies to the return of the deposit or the delivery of an itemized statement of deductions, whichever is applicable.

The 30-day period begins when the resident:

*   Surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   Returns all keys to the owner
*   Provides a written forwarding address

If the owner intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the resident with an **itemized written statement** detailing each deduction along with the remaining balance.

### Permitted Deductions

New Mexico owners may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair resident-caused damage
3.  **Breach of lease terms** — Costs resulting from lease violations
4.  **Unpaid utilities** — If the resident was responsible under the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, and fading paint — cannot be deducted. Document the condition of the unit thoroughly at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If an owner fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 30 days, the resident may recover the full deposit amount. Under §47-8-18(E), if the owner acts in bad faith by failing to comply with the deposit return requirements, the resident may also be entitled to punitive damages and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Resident Rights to Habitable Housing in New Mexico

One of the most fundamental tenant protections under the UORRA is the right to a safe, habitable dwelling. New Mexico Statutes §47-8-20 outlines the owner's maintenance obligations.

### Owner Obligations Under §47-8-20

New Mexico owners must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems in good working order
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water at all times
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal
*   Supply heat during cold weather months as required by local codes

### Resident's Maintenance Responsibilities

Under New Mexico Statutes §47-8-22, residents must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, damage, or remove any part of the premises
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Conduct themselves in a manner that does not disturb other residents' peaceful enjoyment

### Repair Remedies for Residents

If an owner fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving written notice, residents have several remedies under the UORRA:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Owner

The first step is always to notify the owner in writing. Under §47-8-27.2, the owner generally has **seven days** to remedy a non-emergency condition after receiving written notice. For conditions that pose an imminent threat to health or safety, the timeframe may be shorter.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

Under §47-8-27.2, if the owner fails to make repairs within seven days after written notice, the resident may have repairs made and deduct the cost from rent. The cost of repair may not exceed one month's rent, and the resident must provide copies of repair receipts to the owner.

#### 3. Termination of Lease

If the owner fails to address a material health or safety violation within the required timeframe, the resident may terminate the rental agreement. The resident must provide written notice of termination and vacate within 30 days.

#### 4. Legal Action

Residents can file a lawsuit against the owner for breach of the habitability warranty, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can New Mexico Owners Enter?

New Mexico law balances the owner's need to access the property with the resident's right to privacy.

### Notice Requirements Under §47-8-24

Under the UORRA, owners must provide **24 hours' notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Entry must occur at reasonable times.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Owners may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs, decorations, alterations, or improvements
*   Supplying necessary or agreed-upon services
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective residents, buyers, or contractors
*   Other purposes agreed upon by both parties

### Emergency Entry

Owners may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, gas leaks, burst pipes, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property. Owners may also enter if they reasonably believe the resident has abandoned the premises.

## Eviction Process in New Mexico

New Mexico's eviction procedures are governed by the UORRA and the New Mexico Rules of Civil Procedure. Owners must follow these procedures precisely; failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

New Mexico owners can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Breaches of significant lease terms
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on or near the premises
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
5.  **Health or safety violations** — Resident actions that endanger the property or other residents

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, owners must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **3-day notice** to pay or vacate (§47-8-33(D))
*   **Material lease violation**: **7-day notice** to remedy or vacate (§47-8-33(A))
*   **Criminal activity or repeated violations**: **3-day unconditional notice** to vacate (§47-8-33(I))
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** (§47-8-37)

### The Eviction Court Process

If the resident does not comply with the notice, the owner can file an action for possession in the appropriate court:

1.  **Filing**: Owner files a complaint for possession with the magistrate or district court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The resident is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 7–10 days
4.  **Judgment**: The judge hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
5.  **Writ of Restitution**: If the owner prevails, the court issues a writ of restitution, and the sheriff can remove the resident

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

New Mexico law strictly prohibits self-help evictions. Owners cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the resident
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove resident belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the resident

Violations can result in liability for actual damages plus civil penalties under §47-8-36.

## Retaliation Protections

New Mexico Statutes §47-8-39 protects residents from retaliatory actions by owners. An owner may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in response to a resident:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right granted by the UORRA
*   Joining or organizing a resident association

If retaliatory action occurs within six months of a protected activity, the resident may raise retaliation as a defense to eviction and may recover damages.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in New Mexico

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Neither party is required to give notice of non-renewal unless the lease specifies otherwise. If the resident remains after the lease expires and the owner continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement under §47-8-37.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before termination under §47-8-37.

### Early Termination

Residents may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Owner's material breach of the lease or the UORRA
*   Domestic violence situations (under the Victim Protection Act, §47-8-33(J))
*   Uninhabitable conditions that the owner refuses to remedy

Otherwise, residents who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the owner re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. New Mexico owners have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
