# Pennsylvania Lease Agreement Guide: What Landlords Must Include in 2026

![Pennsylvania Lease Agreement Guide 2026](/assets/pennsylvania-lease-agreement-guide-hero.webp)

Creating a legally compliant and comprehensive lease agreement is one of the most important tasks for Pennsylvania landlords. A well-drafted lease protects your property investment, clarifies expectations, and reduces the risk of disputes with tenants. Pennsylvania landlord-tenant law, primarily governed by the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951 and various provisions in Title 68 of the Pennsylvania Statutes, establishes specific requirements that must be included in every residential lease.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything Pennsylvania landlords need to know about creating legally compliant lease agreements in 2026. We'll cover required disclosures, essential clauses, security deposit rules, habitability standards, and best practices for protecting both yourself and your tenants. Whether you're managing properties in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, or rural Pennsylvania, this guide applies to your rental operations.

By the end of this article, you'll understand exactly what must be included in your Pennsylvania lease agreements to ensure compliance and minimize risk. Let's start with the legal framework governing Pennsylvania leases.

## Legal Framework: Pennsylvania Landlord-Tenant Law

Pennsylvania's landlord-tenant relationship is primarily governed by several key statutes:

- **Pennsylvania Statutes Title 68 §250.101-250.602**: The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951
- **Title 68 §250.511-250.512**: Security deposit regulations and interest requirements
- **Title 68 §250.206**: Landlord responsibilities and habitability
- **Title 35 §1700-1**: Clean Indoor Air Act (smoking regulations)

These statutes establish baseline requirements for lease agreements, though landlords and tenants can negotiate additional terms as long as they don't violate statutory protections. Pennsylvania law gives considerable flexibility to lease agreements while ensuring fundamental rights are protected.

### Written vs. Oral Leases

While Pennsylvania law recognizes both written and oral lease agreements, **written leases are strongly recommended** for several critical reasons:

1. **Documentation**: Written agreements provide clear evidence of terms if disputes arise
2. **Specificity**: Complex terms are difficult to prove in oral agreements
3. **Legal requirements**: Certain disclosures must be in writing
4. **Enforceability**: Courts favor written agreements with clear language
5. **Professionalism**: Written leases demonstrate professionalism and protect both parties

For any lease exceeding one year, Pennsylvania's Statute of Frauds requires a written agreement. However, even for month-to-month or shorter fixed-term leases, always use written agreements.

## Required Disclosures and Clauses

Pennsylvania law mandates several specific disclosures and provisions that must be included in residential lease agreements.

### 1. Landlord and Owner Information

Your lease must clearly identify:

- **Landlord's name and address**: For service of legal notices
- **Property owner's name**: If different from the managing landlord
- **Agent or manager information**: If applicable, including contact details

This information ensures tenants know who to contact for repairs, emergencies, and legal matters. Pennsylvania Statutes Title 68 §250.206 requires landlords to disclose this information at the beginning of the tenancy.

### 2. Lead-Based Paint Disclosure (Pre-1978 Properties)

For properties built before 1978, **federal law requires lead-based paint disclosures**:

- **Disclosure form**: Use the EPA-approved lead paint disclosure form
- **Known hazards**: Disclose any known lead paint or hazards
- **Available records**: Provide any available reports or records
- **Pamphlet**: Give tenants the EPA pamphlet "Protect Your Family from Lead in Your Home"
- **Acknowledgment**: Both parties must sign acknowledging the disclosure

Failure to comply can result in significant penalties, including:
- Civil penalties up to $19,507 per violation
- Triple damages if tenants sue for lead poisoning
- Criminal penalties in extreme cases

Even if you're unsure about lead paint presence, you must provide the disclosure form and pamphlet.

### 3. Security Deposit Information

Your lease must clearly state:

- **Amount of security deposit**: Exact dollar amount collected
- **Purpose**: What the deposit covers (damage, cleaning, unpaid rent)
- **Bank information**: Name and address of the financial institution holding the deposit (required in Pennsylvania)
- **Interest provisions**: For tenancies of two years or longer, tenants are entitled to annual interest on deposits
- **Return conditions**: Circumstances under which deductions will be made
- **Timeline**: 30-day return requirement after lease termination

Pennsylvania Statutes Title 68 §250.511 governs security deposit requirements in detail.

### 4. Habitability and Maintenance Responsibilities

Your lease should clearly outline:

- **Landlord's maintenance obligations**: Structural repairs, heating, plumbing, electrical systems
- **Tenant's responsibilities**: Keeping the unit clean, reporting damages, minor repairs
- **Repair request procedures**: How tenants should report issues
- **Emergency contact information**: For after-hours emergencies

While Pennsylvania law (Title 68 §250.206) establishes baseline habitability requirements, your lease should provide specifics.

### 5. Smoke-Free and Smoking Policies

Pennsylvania's Clean Indoor Air Act (Title 35 §1700-1) prohibits smoking in many public places. While the Act doesn't directly regulate residential units, many landlords implement smoke-free policies. If you do:

- **Clearly state the policy**: Specify whether the entire property or just certain areas are smoke-free
- **Define "smoking"**: Include cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, and other tobacco products
- **Specify consequences**: Outline penalties for violations (warnings, fines, potential eviction)
- **Include common areas**: Clarify that smoking restrictions apply to hallways, lobbies, balconies

Smoke-free policies are becoming increasingly common and can protect property value while appealing to non-smoking tenants.

### 6. Utility Responsibilities

Clearly specify which utilities are:

- **Included in rent**: Covered by the landlord
- **Tenant's responsibility**: Must be paid directly by the tenant
- **Shared/metered**: How costs are divided if utilities are shared

This clarity prevents disputes and ensures tenants understand their financial obligations.

### 7. Entry and Access Rights

Pennsylvania law doesn't specify required notice periods for landlord entry, so your lease should establish:

- **Notice requirements**: Typically 24-48 hours for non-emergency entry
- **Acceptable reasons**: Repairs, inspections, showings to prospective tenants
- **Emergency provisions**: Immediate access for fires, floods, gas leaks
- **Tenant privacy**: Respecting reasonable expectations of privacy

Balancing your access rights with tenant privacy protections helps maintain positive relationships.

## Pennsylvania Security Deposit Rules

Security deposits are one of the most regulated aspects of Pennsylvania lease agreements. Understanding these rules is crucial.

### Deposit Limits

Pennsylvania Statutes Title 68 §250.511 establishes maximum security deposit amounts:

- **First year of tenancy**: Maximum of **2 months' rent**
- **Second and subsequent years**: Maximum of **1 month's rent**

After the first year anniversary, landlords must return any excess deposit amount over one month's rent to the tenant, unless the lease specifically allows retention based on damage or unpaid rent concerns.

**Example**: If monthly rent is $1,000:
- Maximum deposit in year 1: $2,000
- Maximum deposit starting year 2: $1,000
- You must return $1,000 to the tenant after the first year (unless authorized by lease to retain due to damage)

### Escrow Account Requirements

Pennsylvania law requires landlords to place security deposits in **federally or state-regulated financial institutions** in Pennsylvania. The lease must identify:
- Name of the institution
- Address of the institution
- Amount deposited

The deposit must be held in an escrow account or in the landlord's name as trustee for the tenant. Commingling deposits with personal funds is permitted as long as the landlord maintains sufficient funds to cover all deposits.

### Interest on Security Deposits

For tenancies of **two years or longer**, Pennsylvania law requires landlords to pay tenants interest on security deposits annually. The interest rate is:

- The rate earned on the account, OR
- If the deposit is not in an interest-bearing account, the interest rate must be equivalent to the difference between the amount on the first day and the last day the tenant occupies the premises

Many landlords pay interest annually on August 1st or at the lease anniversary date. Keep detailed records of interest payments.

### 30-Day Return Requirement

After the tenant vacates, Pennsylvania landlords must:

1. **Return the full deposit**, OR
2. **Provide an itemized list of deductions** with the remaining balance

This must occur within **30 days** of lease termination. Failure to comply can result in:
- Forfeiture of your right to make deductions
- Liability for double the wrongfully withheld amount
- Court costs and attorney's fees if the tenant sues

The itemized statement must include specific descriptions of damages and associated costs.

## Essential Lease Clauses for Pennsylvania Landlords

Beyond required disclosures, well-drafted Pennsylvania leases should include these essential clauses:

### 1. Lease Term and Renewal

Specify:
- **Start and end dates**: For fixed-term leases
- **Renewal provisions**: Automatic renewal vs. requiring new agreement
- **Notice requirements**: For termination or non-renewal (typically 30-60 days)
- **Holdover provisions**: What happens if tenant stays beyond lease term

### 2. Rent Amount and Payment Terms

Include:
- **Monthly rent amount**: Clear dollar figure
- **Due date**: Typically the 1st of each month
- **Payment method**: Check, money order, electronic payment, online portal
- **Payment location**: Where and how to submit payment
- **Late fees**: Amount and when they apply (must be reasonable)
- **Grace period**: If any (typically 3-5 days)
- **Returned check fees**: Penalties for insufficient funds

### 3. Occupancy Limits

Define:
- **Named tenants**: All adults who will live in the property
- **Occupancy restrictions**: Maximum number of occupants
- **Guest policies**: Limitations on extended guests

Pennsylvania doesn't have statewide occupancy standards, but the federal Fair Housing Act and local codes may impose limits. Generally, **two persons per bedroom** is considered reasonable.

### 4. Pet Policies

If allowing pets:
- **Types permitted**: Dogs, cats, other animals
- **Size/breed restrictions**: Any limitations
- **Number of pets**: Maximum allowed
- **Pet deposit or fee**: Additional refundable or non-refundable charges
- **Pet rules**: Waste cleanup, leash requirements, noise control

If prohibiting pets, clearly state this and include exceptions for service animals and emotional support animals as required by fair housing laws.

### 5. Maintenance and Repair Procedures

Outline:
- **Tenant's reporting obligations**: How and when to report issues
- **Landlord's response timeline**: When repairs will be addressed
- **Emergency procedures**: 24/7 contact for urgent issues
- **Tenant's repair limitations**: What tenants cannot attempt themselves
- **Maintenance standards**: Expectations for cleanliness and care

### 6. Alterations and Modifications

Specify whether tenants can:
- Paint walls
- Install fixtures or hardware
- Make structural changes
- Require written approval for any alterations

Most leases prohibit alterations without landlord consent.

### 7. Subletting and Assignment

Define:
- **Whether subletting is permitted**: Most landlords prohibit or require approval
- **Assignment provisions**: Transferring the lease to another party
- **Approval process**: Requirements for landlord consent
- **Tenant's continuing liability**: Original tenant often remains responsible

### 8. Property Rules and Regulations

Include:
- **Noise restrictions**: Quiet hours
- **Common area usage**: Laundry, parking, storage
- **Prohibited activities**: Illegal activities, nuisances, hazardous materials
- **Parking regulations**: Assigned spaces, guest parking
- **Trash disposal**: Procedures and schedules

### 9. Insurance Requirements

Specify:
- **Landlord's insurance**: Clarify what your insurance covers (structure, liability)
- **Renter's insurance**: Strongly recommend or require tenants to carry renter's insurance
- **Liability disclaimer**: Clarify landlord is not liable for tenant's personal property

Pennsylvania doesn't require renters insurance, but recommending it protects both parties.

### 10. Default and Remedies

Outline:
- **What constitutes default**: Non-payment, lease violations, property damage
- **Notice procedures**: Warnings and cure periods
- **Eviction process**: Reference to legal procedures
- **Tenant's right to cure**: Opportunity to fix violations
- **Attorney's fees**: Who pays legal fees in disputes

## Habitability Standards and Landlord Obligations

Pennsylvania Statutes Title 68 §250.206 establishes minimum habitability standards landlords must maintain.

### Required Conditions

Landlords must provide:

1. **Structural integrity**: Roof, walls, floors, and foundation in good repair
2. **Weather protection**: Windows and doors that close and lock properly
3. **Plumbing**: Hot and cold running water with adequate pressure
4. **Heating**: Adequate heating systems that function properly

### Tenant's Right to Repairs

If landlords fail to make necessary repairs after receiving notice:

1. **Repair and deduct**: Tenants may make repairs and deduct costs from rent (limited circumstances)
2. **Withhold rent**: Place rent in escrow until repairs are made (requires legal process)
3. **Terminate lease**: For serious habitability violations
4. **Sue for damages**: Recover costs for injuries or losses

To avoid these scenarios, **respond promptly to repair requests** and maintain properties in compliance with housing codes.

## Special Considerations for Philadelphia and Pittsburgh

While state law applies throughout Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have additional local regulations.

### Philadelphia Rental Requirements

- **Rental license**: All rental properties must be licensed
- **Certificate of rental suitability**: Required before renting

## Common Mistakes Pennsylvania Landlords Make

Avoid these frequent errors that can lead to legal complications:

### 1. Charging Excessive Security Deposits

**Mistake**: Charging more than 2 months' rent in the first year or more than 1 month's rent thereafter.

**Solution**: Use the [Security Deposit Calculator](/tools/security-deposit-calculator) to ensure compliance. After the first year, reduce deposits to one month's rent or less.

### 2. Missing Lead Paint Disclosures

**Mistake**: Failing to provide lead paint disclosure forms and EPA pamphlet for pre-1978 properties.

**Solution**: Include lead paint disclosures in every lease for older properties, even if you're unaware of lead paint presence.

### 3. Vague Maintenance Responsibilities

**Mistake**: Unclear language about who handles specific repairs.

**Solution**: Explicitly list landlord and tenant maintenance responsibilities with examples.

### 4. Not Specifying Deposit Bank Information

**Mistake**: Failing to disclose where security deposits are held.

**Solution**: Include the bank name and address in every lease agreement as required by Pennsylvania law.

### 5. Ignoring Interest Requirements

**Mistake**: Not paying interest on deposits for tenancies over two years.

**Solution**: Set annual reminders to pay interest and keep detailed records of payments.

### 6. No Written Lease

**Mistake**: Relying on oral agreements or informal arrangements.

**Solution**: Always use written lease agreements, even for month-to-month tenancies.

### 7. Illegal Clauses

**Mistake**: Including provisions that waive tenant rights or violate fair housing laws.

**Solution**: Have your lease reviewed by LeaseLens or an attorney to identify problematic clauses.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I include a clause that waives the tenant's right to a jury trial?**
A: Generally no. Clauses that waive statutory tenant rights are often unenforceable in Pennsylvania. Avoid including terms that eliminate fundamental tenant protections.

**Q: Do I need separate leases for roommates?**
A: You can structure this either way. Most landlords prefer one lease with all adult tenants listed, making them jointly and severally liable. This means any tenant can be held responsible for the full rent amount.

**Q: Can I charge a non-refundable deposit in Pennsylvania?**
A: Pennsylvania law refers to "security deposits," which are generally refundable. You can charge non-refundable fees for specific purposes (like pet fees), but label them clearly as "non-refundable fees" and specify their purpose. Don't call refundable deposits "non-refundable" as this violates Pennsylvania law.

**Q: What if I want to increase rent mid-lease?**
A: You cannot increase rent during a fixed-term lease unless the lease explicitly allows it and specifies the conditions. For month-to-month tenancies, you can increase rent with proper notice (typically 30 days is customary, though Pennsylvania doesn't specify a minimum).

**Q: Do I need an attorney to draft my lease?**
A: While not legally required, having an attorney review your lease is wise, especially when you're starting out. Alternatively, use LeaseLens to analyze your lease for compliance issues and common problems.

**Q: Can I include automatic renewal clauses?**
A: Yes, but be careful with the language. Clearly state the renewal terms and notice requirements for tenants who wish to terminate rather than renew. Ensure the clause is prominent and fair.
