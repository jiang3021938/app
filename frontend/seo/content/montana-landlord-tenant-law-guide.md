![Montana Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/montana-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Understanding **Montana landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in Big Sky Country. Whether you own rental units in Billings, manage properties in Missoula, or are a tenant in Bozeman, knowing the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Montana's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by the **Montana Residential Landlord and Tenant Act of 1977**, codified in Montana Code Annotated (MCA) Title 70, Chapters 24 and 25 (§§70-24-101 through 70-25-206). This comprehensive statute establishes the core rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants throughout the state.

This guide covers the most important aspects of Montana landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. Whether you're a tenant seeking to understand your rights or a landlord working to maintain compliance, this article is your essential resource.

## Overview of Montana's Residential Landlord and Tenant Act

The Montana Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, found in MCA Title 70, Chapters 24 and 25, provides a comprehensive framework for residential rental relationships. The Act applies to most residential rental agreements in Montana, with limited exceptions for institutional housing and certain owner-occupied properties.

### Key Principles

The Act establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and habitable
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith throughout the tenancy
*   Lease agreements cannot waive the protections provided by the Act
*   Retaliatory actions by landlords are prohibited

## Montana Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Montana's security deposit rules are outlined in MCA §70-25-201 through §70-25-206.

### No Statutory Limit on Security Deposit Amount

Montana does **not impose a statutory cap** on the amount a landlord may collect as a security deposit. Landlords are free to set the deposit at any amount they deem appropriate. However, market norms in Montana typically range between one and two months' rent for most residential properties.

Because there is no statutory limit, tenants should carefully review the lease agreement before signing to understand the exact deposit amount and the conditions for its return.

### The 30-Day Return Rule (10 Days if No Deductions)

Under MCA §70-25-202, landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the rental agreement terminates. However, if the landlord does not intend to make any deductions, the deposit must be returned within **10 days**.

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with a written **itemized statement** of deductions within the 30-day period.

The return period begins when:

*   The tenant surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   All keys are returned to the landlord
*   The rental agreement has terminated

The landlord must mail the deposit and statement to the tenant's last known address or forwarding address.

### Permitted Deductions

Montana landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Cleaning costs** — To restore the unit to the condition at move-in, beyond normal wear and tear
4.  **Other lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches

Normal wear and tear — such as minor wall scuffs, small nail holes, gently worn carpet, and faded paint — cannot be deducted. Thorough documentation at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists is essential.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within the required timeframe, the tenant may pursue legal action. Under MCA §70-25-203, a landlord who wrongfully withholds a deposit may be liable for the amount wrongfully withheld plus court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Montana

One of the most fundamental tenant protections under Montana law is the right to a safe, habitable dwelling. MCA §70-24-303 outlines the landlord's maintenance obligations.

### Landlord Obligations Under §70-24-303

Montana landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, and other systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Provide adequate heat during winter months
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal where applicable
*   Maintain appliances supplied or required by the lease agreement

### Tenant Maintenance Responsibilities Under §70-24-321

Montana tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, or damage the property
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Allow the landlord reasonable access for repairs and inspections

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving written notice, tenants have several remedies under Montana law:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

Under MCA §70-24-406, tenants must first provide written notice to the landlord describing the condition that requires repair. The landlord generally has **14 days** to remedy the condition, or a shorter period for emergencies materially affecting health and safety.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

Under MCA §70-24-406, if the landlord fails to make essential repairs after proper notice, a tenant may contract for repairs and deduct the cost from rent. The tenant must provide notice and the repair cost generally should not exceed one month's rent.

#### 3. Rent Reduction

If the landlord's failure to maintain habitability materially affects the value of the rental unit, the tenant may be entitled to a reduction in rent proportional to the diminished value.

#### 4. Lease Termination

If the landlord fails to remedy a material health or safety violation within the required timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement under MCA §70-24-406. The tenant must provide written notice of termination.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit for breach of the habitability warranty, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can Montana Landlords Enter?

Montana law balances the landlord's need to access the property with the tenant's right to privacy and quiet enjoyment.

### The 24-Hour Notice Requirement

Under MCA §70-24-312, landlords must provide at least **24 hours' notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Entry must occur at reasonable times.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services
*   Other purposes permitted by the lease agreement

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as:

*   Fire or imminent danger to persons or property
*   Burst pipes, gas leaks, or other urgent maintenance issues
*   Reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the premises

If a landlord repeatedly enters without proper notice, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief and may recover damages under MCA §70-24-312.

## Eviction Process in Montana

Montana's eviction procedures are governed by MCA §70-24-422 through §70-24-442 and MCA Title 70, Chapter 27 (forcible entry and detainer). Landlords must follow these procedures precisely — failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Montana landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Significant breaches of the lease agreement
3.  **Substantial damage to the property** — Willful or negligent destruction
4.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises, particularly drug-related offenses
5.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires without renewal

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper written notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **3-day notice** to pay or vacate (MCA §70-24-422(2))
*   **Material lease violation (curable)**: **14-day notice** to remedy; if not cured, the lease terminates at the end of the 14-day period (MCA §70-24-422(1)(b))
*   **Repeated lease violations**: If the same or similar violation recurs within **6 months**, the landlord may issue a **5-day unconditional notice** to vacate (MCA §70-24-422(1)(c))
*   **Criminal activity or violence**: **3-day unconditional notice** to vacate (MCA §70-24-422(1)(e))
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** (MCA §70-24-441)

### The Eviction Court Process (Forcible Entry and Detainer)

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the landlord can file a forcible entry and detainer action:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a complaint with the district court or justice's court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within a few days to two weeks
4.  **Trial**: Both parties present evidence
5.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Possession**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of possession, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Prohibited

Montana law strictly prohibits self-help evictions under MCA §70-24-411. Landlords cannot:

*   Change or remove locks
*   Shut off utilities (heat, water, electricity, gas)
*   Remove doors or windows
*   Remove tenant belongings without a court order

Violations can result in liability for actual damages plus up to **three months' periodic rent** and reasonable attorney's fees under MCA §70-24-411.

## Retaliation Protections Under §70-24-431

MCA §70-24-431 protects tenants from retaliatory actions. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in retaliation for a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right granted by the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

If retaliatory conduct occurs within **six months** of a protected activity, it is presumed retaliatory. The landlord bears the burden of proving a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the action.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Montana

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Neither party is required to give notice of non-renewal unless the lease specifies otherwise. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement on the same terms.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before the end of a rental period under MCA §70-24-441.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act
*   Domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking (MCA §70-24-442 provides specific protections)
*   Unit becomes uninhabitable due to casualty damage

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Montana landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property under MCA §70-24-426.
