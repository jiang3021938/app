![Wyoming Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/wyoming-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Navigating **Wyoming landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Cowboy State. Whether you own rental units in Cheyenne, manage properties in Casper, or are a tenant in Laramie, understanding the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Wyoming's residential landlord-tenant statutes are found primarily in **Wyoming Statutes Title 1, Chapter 21** (Forcible Entry and Detainer), which governs evictions, and **Title 34, Chapter 2** (Landlord and Tenant), which addresses the general landlord-tenant relationship including security deposits. Together these statutes establish the baseline rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of Wyoming landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities under Wyoming law.

## Overview of Wyoming Landlord-Tenant Law

Wyoming's landlord-tenant framework is built on two primary statute groups: **Title 1, Chapter 21** for eviction procedures and **Title 34, Chapter 2** for general landlord-tenant provisions. Wyoming has a relatively limited statutory framework compared to some states, placing greater emphasis on the terms of the lease agreement itself.

### Key Principles

Wyoming landlord-tenant law establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and fit for habitation
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must honor the terms of the lease agreement
*   Lease agreements must comply with state law requirements
*   Proper legal procedures must be followed for evictions

## Wyoming Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Wyoming's rules are outlined in Wyoming Statutes §1-21-1208.

### Deposit Amount Limits

**Wyoming does not impose a statutory limit on security deposit amounts.** Landlords may charge whatever amount they deem appropriate. However, market competition and practical considerations typically keep deposits in the range of one to two months' rent. Courts may consider unreasonably high deposits in the context of contract disputes.

There is no statutory requirement that the deposit be held in a separate account or that interest be paid on the deposit.

### The 30-Day Return Rule (15 Days if No Deductions)

Under Wyoming Statutes §1-21-1208, landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the lease has terminated. However, if the landlord does not intend to make any deductions from the deposit, the deposit must be returned within **15 days**.

The return period begins when:

*   The tenant has vacated the premises
*   The lease term has ended or been properly terminated
*   The landlord has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with an **itemized written statement** detailing each deduction and the amount withheld for each item within the 30-day period.

### Permitted Deductions

Wyoming landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Breach of lease terms** — Costs resulting from lease violations
4.  **Cleaning costs** — If the unit was not left in a reasonably clean condition
5.  **Unpaid utilities** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, and fading paint — cannot be deducted. Document the condition of the unit thoroughly at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within the required timeframe, the tenant may be entitled to recover the full deposit amount. Under §1-21-1208, the landlord may be liable for the wrongfully withheld amount. In cases of willful noncompliance, the tenant may also recover additional damages and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Wyoming

Wyoming recognizes the implied warranty of habitability through case law, requiring landlords to provide and maintain rental units that are safe and fit for human habitation.

### Landlord Obligations Under Wyoming Law

Wyoming landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, and ventilating systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide adequate heating facilities capable of maintaining a reasonable temperature
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Maintain the structural integrity of the building, including roofs, walls, and foundations

### Tenant's Maintenance Responsibilities

Under Wyoming law, tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, damage, or remove any part of the premises
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving notice, tenants have several remedies:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is always to notify the landlord in writing. The landlord should be given a reasonable time to remedy the condition, typically **14 days** for non-emergency conditions. For conditions that pose an imminent threat to health or safety, shorter notice may be appropriate.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

In certain circumstances, Wyoming tenants may arrange for necessary repairs and deduct the reasonable cost from rent after proper notice and the landlord's failure to act.

#### 3. Termination of Lease

If the landlord fails to address a material health or safety violation within a reasonable timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement with written notice.

#### 4. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit against the landlord for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can Wyoming Landlords Enter?

Wyoming law provides general guidelines on landlord entry, balancing the landlord's property rights with the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment.

### Reasonable Notice Requirement

Wyoming does not have a specific statute mandating a set number of hours for advance notice. However, landlords are generally expected to provide **reasonable notice** before entering a rental unit. In practice, most courts and legal practitioners consider **24 hours** to be reasonable notice.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Addressing emergency situations
*   Other purposes agreed upon by both parties

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, gas leaks, burst pipes, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property. Landlords may also enter if they reasonably believe the tenant has abandoned the premises.

## Eviction Process in Wyoming

Wyoming's eviction procedures are governed by Wyoming Statutes Title 1, Chapter 21 (Forcible Entry and Detainer). Landlords must follow these procedures precisely; failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Wyoming landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Breaches of significant lease terms
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
5.  **Health or safety violations** — Tenant actions that endanger the property or other tenants

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: A **3-day notice** to pay or vacate under §1-21-1003
*   **Material lease violation**: Written notice giving the tenant an opportunity to cure, typically within a **reasonable timeframe**
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: Written notice given at least **one full rental period** in advance (generally 30 days)
*   **Holdover after lease expiration**: **3-day notice** to vacate under §1-21-1003
*   **Criminal activity**: The landlord may pursue expedited proceedings

### The Eviction Court Process

If the tenant does not comply with the notice, the landlord can file an eviction action (forcible entry and detainer) in circuit court:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a complaint for forcible entry and detainer with the circuit court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint at least **3 days** before the hearing
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 3–12 days under §1-21-1003
4.  **Judgment**: The judge hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
5.  **Writ of Restitution**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of restitution, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

Wyoming law prohibits self-help evictions. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant

Violations can result in liability for actual damages plus additional penalties.

## Retaliation Protections

While Wyoming does not have a comprehensive retaliation statute, courts generally disfavor retaliatory evictions. A landlord should not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in response to a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any legal right
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

Tenants may raise retaliation as a defense to eviction if they can demonstrate the landlord's action was motivated by the tenant's exercise of a protected right.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Wyoming

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement under Wyoming common law.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide written notice at least **one full rental period** in advance. In practice, this is typically **30 days** before the next rent due date.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or habitability obligations
*   Domestic violence situations (under Wyoming Statutes §1-21-1301 et seq.)
*   Uninhabitable conditions that the landlord refuses to remedy

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Wyoming landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
