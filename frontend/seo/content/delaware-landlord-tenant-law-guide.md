# Delaware Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Delaware Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/delaware-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Understanding **Delaware landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the First State. Whether you own rental units in Wilmington, manage properties in Dover, or rent an apartment in Newark, Delaware's detailed statutory framework requires careful attention to compliance requirements.

Delaware's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by the **Delaware Residential Landlord-Tenant Code**, found in Delaware Code Title 25, Chapter 55 (§§5101 through 5907). This comprehensive code provides a balanced framework of rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants.

This guide covers the most important aspects of Delaware landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules.

## Overview of the Delaware Residential Landlord-Tenant Code

The Delaware Residential Landlord-Tenant Code (Title 25, Chapter 55) is one of the more detailed landlord-tenant statutes in the country. It applies to most residential rental agreements in Delaware, covering single-family homes, apartments, condominiums, and other dwelling units.

### Key Principles

The Code establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide safe, habitable rental housing
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith
*   Lease agreements cannot waive the protections provided by the Code
*   Retaliatory actions by landlords are prohibited
*   The summary possession process must be used for all evictions

## Delaware Security Deposit Law

Delaware has one of the most tenant-friendly security deposit frameworks in the country, with strict limits and short return timelines. The relevant provisions are found in Delaware Code Title 25, §5514.

### Security Deposit Limit: 1 Month's Rent Maximum

Under §5514, Delaware landlords may charge a security deposit of no more than **one month's rent**. This is one of the strictest deposit caps in the country.

For example, if the monthly rent is $1,400, the maximum security deposit is $1,400. This limit applies regardless of how the deposit is labeled — "security deposit," "pet deposit," "damage deposit," or any other name.

**Exception for month-to-month tenancies**: For month-to-month leases, the limit remains one month's rent. There is no exception for higher-risk tenancies.

### The 20-Day Return Rule

Under §5514(g), landlords must return the security deposit within **20 days** after the tenant vacates the premises. If deductions are made, the landlord must provide the tenant with an **itemized list** of damages within that 20-day period.

The 20-day clock begins when:

*   The tenant surrenders possession
*   The lease terminates
*   The tenant provides a forwarding address (whichever occurs last)

### Permitted Deductions

Delaware landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Damage due to lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches
4.  **Unpaid utility charges** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet, fading paint — cannot be deducted.

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

Delaware imposes significant penalties for security deposit violations. Under §5514(g), if a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 20 days, the landlord forfeits the right to withhold any portion of the deposit and must return the full amount. In cases of bad faith retention, the tenant may recover **double the deposit amount** plus court costs.

### Pet Deposits

Delaware law permits a **nonrefundable pet deposit** that does not count toward the one-month security deposit cap. However, it cannot be unreasonable in amount. This is separate from the refundable security deposit.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Delaware

The right to habitable housing is a cornerstone of Delaware's Landlord-Tenant Code. The landlord's maintenance obligations are outlined in §5305.

### Landlord Obligations Under §5305

Delaware landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems
*   Provide running water and a reasonable amount of hot water
*   Provide heat during the heating season
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal
*   Maintain smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors
*   Maintain all appliances and facilities supplied by the landlord
*   Provide extermination services when necessary (unless caused by the tenant)

### Tenant Responsibilities Under §5507

Tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use all fixtures, appliances, and systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently damage the property
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord
*   Not disturb neighbors' peaceful enjoyment

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain habitability after receiving proper notice, tenants have several remedies under Delaware law:

#### 1. Written Notice

The first step is to provide written notice to the landlord. Under Delaware's Code, the landlord must begin repairs within a reasonable time. For conditions affecting health and safety, action should be prompt.

#### 2. Rent Escrow (§5308)

Delaware's rent escrow statute is a powerful tool for tenants. If the landlord fails to correct conditions that affect habitability after receiving notice, the tenant can petition the Justice of the Peace Court to deposit rent into escrow until repairs are made. The court can also order:

*   Rent reduction until repairs are completed
*   Release of escrowed funds for repairs
*   Termination of the lease

#### 3. Repair and Deduct

In certain circumstances, tenants may make necessary repairs and deduct the cost from rent. The repair must be essential to habitability, and proper notice must have been given to the landlord first.

#### 4. Lease Termination

For serious habitability violations, tenants may terminate the rental agreement after providing proper written notice.

## Entry Rights in Delaware

### The 48-Hour Notice Requirement

Under Delaware Code §5509(b), landlords must provide at least **48 hours' notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. The notice can be written or oral.

Entry must occur at reasonable times, and the tenant must not unreasonably withhold consent.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as:

*   Fire or imminent danger to persons or property
*   Burst pipes, gas leaks, or other urgent maintenance issues
*   Reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the premises

Repeated unauthorized entry can result in liability for the landlord. Tenants who experience repeated violations can seek injunctive relief from the court.

## Eviction Process in Delaware

Delaware's eviction process, known as **summary possession**, is governed by Delaware Code Title 25, §§5701 through 5716. The process is handled through the Justice of the Peace Courts.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Delaware landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Violation of lease terms** — Material breaches of the lease agreement
3.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
4.  **Violation of landlord-tenant code** — Tenant actions that violate the statutory code
5.  **Drug-related criminal activity** — Illegal drug activity on the premises
6.  **Criminal activity threatening health/safety** — Serious criminal conduct

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for summary possession, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **5-day notice** to pay or vacate (§5502)
*   **Month-to-month tenancy (non-payment default)**: **60-day notice** to terminate (§5106)
*   **Lease violation (curable)**: **7-day notice** to remedy the violation
*   **Drug-related or criminal activity**: **7-day unconditional notice** to vacate
*   **Holding over (lease expiration)**: **60-day notice** for tenancies of one year or more; **30-day notice** for shorter tenancies

### The Summary Possession Process

If the tenant doesn't comply with the notice, the landlord files a summary possession action:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a complaint with the Justice of the Peace Court
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 15–25 days
4.  **Trial**: Both parties present evidence and arguments
5.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Possession**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of possession after a **5-day waiting period**, and the constable can remove the tenant

### Appeals

Tenants can appeal a summary possession judgment to the Court of Common Pleas within **15 days** of the judgment.

### Self-Help Evictions Are Strictly Prohibited

Delaware law strictly prohibits self-help evictions under §5313. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove the tenant's belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant
*   Block access to the rental unit

Violations can result in the tenant recovering actual damages, plus a penalty of up to **three months' rent** and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Retaliation Protections Under §5516

Delaware provides strong anti-retaliation protections. A landlord may not retaliate against a tenant for:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency or court
*   Organizing or joining a tenant association
*   Exercising any right under the Landlord-Tenant Code

If retaliatory conduct occurs within **90 days** of a protected activity, it is presumed retaliatory. The landlord must prove a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the action.

## Lease Termination and Renewal

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires at the end of the stated term. Under Delaware law, if the tenant remains and the landlord accepts rent, the tenancy converts to a month-to-month arrangement under the same terms.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

Either party may terminate a month-to-month tenancy by providing at least **60 days' written notice** before the end of a rental period under §5106.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or the Landlord-Tenant Code
*   Domestic violence (Delaware Code Title 25, §5314 provides specific protections)
*   Uninhabitable conditions the landlord refuses to remedy
*   Tenant is 62 or older and entering a nursing home or assisted living facility

Landlords have a statutory duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent when a tenant breaks a lease early.

### Rent Increases

Delaware does not have statewide rent control. Landlords can increase rent, but must provide at least **60 days' written notice** for month-to-month tenancies. Rent cannot be increased during a fixed-term lease unless the lease specifically allows it.
