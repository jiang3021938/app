# Alaska Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Alaska Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/alaska-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Understanding **Alaska landlord-tenant law** is critical for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Last Frontier. Whether you own rental units in Anchorage, manage properties in Fairbanks, or rent an apartment in Juneau, knowing the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Alaska's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by the **Alaska Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (AURLTA)**, found in Alaska Statutes Title 34, Chapter 03 (AS §34.03.010 through §34.03.380). This comprehensive statute establishes rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants across the state.

This guide covers the most important aspects of Alaska landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. Whether you're a tenant seeking to understand your rights or a landlord working to maintain compliance, this article will serve as your essential resource.

## Overview of Alaska's Landlord-Tenant Act

The Alaska URLTA, codified at AS §34.03, provides a comprehensive framework for residential rental relationships. The Act applies to most residential rental agreements in Alaska, with limited exceptions for certain institutional housing and transient occupancies.

### Fundamental Rights and Obligations

Under Alaska's URLTA, both parties have core rights:

**Tenant Rights:**
*   The right to a safe, habitable dwelling
*   The right to privacy and proper notice before landlord entry
*   The right to timely repairs
*   Protection against retaliatory eviction
*   The right to proper security deposit handling and return

**Landlord Rights:**
*   The right to collect rent when due
*   The right to maintain and protect the property
*   The right to enforce lease terms
*   The right to evict tenants who violate lease terms through proper legal procedures

## Alaska Security Deposit Law

Security deposit disputes are among the most common landlord-tenant conflicts. Alaska has some of the more detailed security deposit statutes in the country, found in AS §34.03.070.

### Security Deposit Limit: 2 Months' Rent Maximum

Under AS §34.03.070(a), Alaska landlords may charge a security deposit of up to **two months' rent**. This is a hard cap that applies statewide.

For example, if the monthly rent is $1,500, the maximum security deposit is $3,000. This limit includes all refundable deposits collected at the start of the tenancy, regardless of how they are labeled (e.g., "pet deposit," "cleaning deposit").

Landlords may also collect a **nonrefundable pet deposit** that does not exceed one month's rent, but this is separate from the security deposit.

### The 14-Day and 30-Day Return Rules

Alaska has a tiered return timeline under AS §34.03.070(g):

*   **14 days**: If no deductions are made, the full deposit must be returned within **14 days** after the tenant vacates and provides a forwarding address
*   **30 days**: If the landlord intends to make deductions for damages, the deposit (minus deductions) and an **itemized statement** must be returned within **30 days**

The landlord must mail the deposit and statement to the tenant's last known address or forwarding address.

### Permitted Deductions

Alaska landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Cleaning costs** — To restore the unit to the condition at move-in, minus normal wear and tear
4.  **Unpaid utility charges** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease
5.  **Other lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches

Normal wear and tear — such as minor wall scuffs, small nail holes, gently worn carpet, and faded paint — cannot be deducted.

### Itemized Statement Requirements

When making deductions, landlords must provide a written itemized statement that includes:

*   A description of each deduction
*   The amount of each deduction
*   The remaining balance being returned
*   Supporting documentation where available (receipts, estimates, invoices)

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within the required timeframe, the tenant may recover the full deposit amount plus damages. Under AS §34.03.070(d), a landlord who wrongfully withholds a deposit may be liable for up to **twice the amount wrongfully withheld**, plus court costs and attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Alaska

The right to a habitable dwelling is one of the most important tenant protections under Alaska law. AS §34.03.100 outlines the landlord's maintenance obligations.

### Landlord Obligations Under AS §34.03.100

Alaska landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, and ventilating systems in good working order
*   Provide and maintain adequate heating facilities
*   Provide running water and hot water
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal
*   Supply water, hot water, and heat if the building's design does not allow individual tenant control

Given Alaska's extreme climate, maintaining heating systems is particularly critical. Failure to provide adequate heat can create emergency conditions and constitutes a serious breach of the habitability warranty.

### Tenant Responsibilities Under AS §34.03.120

Tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently damage the property
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Allow the landlord reasonable access for repairs and inspections

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain habitability after receiving proper notice, tenants have remedies under Alaska law:

#### 1. Written Notice

Under AS §34.03.180, tenants must first provide written notice to the landlord describing the condition that needs repair. The landlord generally has a reasonable time to address the issue.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

If the landlord fails to make essential repairs after proper notice, tenants may contract for repairs and deduct the cost from rent, subject to limitations. The repair cost typically cannot exceed one month's rent.

#### 3. Rent Withholding / Escrow

For serious habitability issues, tenants may be able to deposit rent with the court until the landlord makes necessary repairs. This must be done through proper legal channels — never simply stop paying rent.

#### 4. Lease Termination

If the landlord's failure to maintain habitability is material, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement under AS §34.03.180 after providing proper written notice.

## Entry Rights: When Can Alaska Landlords Enter?

Alaska law carefully balances the landlord's right to access their property with the tenant's right to privacy.

### The 24-Hour Notice Requirement

Under AS §34.03.140, landlords must provide at least **24 hours' notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Entry must occur at a reasonable time.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services
*   Other purposes permitted by the lease

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as:

*   Fire or imminent danger to persons or property
*   Burst pipes, gas leaks, or other urgent maintenance issues
*   Reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the premises

If a landlord repeatedly enters without proper notice or authorization, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief and recover damages.

## Eviction Process in Alaska

Alaska's eviction procedures are governed by AS §34.03.220 through §34.03.290 and AS §09.45.060 through §09.45.160 (forcible entry and detainer). Landlords must follow these procedures strictly.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Alaska landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Significant breaches of the lease agreement
3.  **Substantial damage to the property** — Willful or negligent destruction
4.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises
5.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires without renewal

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper written notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **7-day notice** to pay or vacate (AS §34.03.220(b))
*   **Material lease violation (curable)**: **10-day notice** to remedy; if the same violation recurs within six months, a **5-day unconditional notice** to vacate (AS §34.03.220(a))
*   **Substantial violation affecting health/safety**: **24-hour notice** in cases involving drug activity, assault, or other serious threats (AS §34.03.220(e))
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** (AS §34.03.290(b))

### The Eviction Court Process (Forcible Entry and Detainer)

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the landlord can file a forcible entry and detainer (FED) action:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files an FED complaint with the district court
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 10–15 days
4.  **Trial**: Both parties present evidence
5.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Assistance**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ, and law enforcement can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Prohibited

Alaska law strictly prohibits self-help evictions. Landlords cannot:

*   Change or remove locks
*   Shut off utilities (heat, water, electricity)
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Block access to the rental unit

Violations of this prohibition can result in actual damages to the tenant, plus up to one and a half months' periodic rent as a penalty under AS §34.03.210.

## Retaliation Protections Under AS §34.03.310

Alaska law protects tenants from retaliatory actions. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or file for eviction in retaliation for a tenant:

*   Complaining about code violations or habitability issues
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right under the URLTA
*   Organizing or participating in a tenant association

If retaliatory conduct occurs within one year of a protected activity, it is presumed retaliatory. The landlord bears the burden of proving a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the action.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Alaska

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease ends automatically at the expiration of the stated term. If the tenant remains with the landlord's consent and continues paying rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement on the same terms.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

Either party may terminate a month-to-month tenancy by providing at least **30 days' written notice** before the end of a rental period under AS §34.03.290(b).

### Week-to-Week Tenancies

For week-to-week tenancies, **14 days' written notice** is required for termination.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or the URLTA
*   Domestic violence or sexual assault (AS §34.03.340 provides specific protections)
*   Unit becomes uninhabitable due to casualty damage

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term ends. Landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent.
