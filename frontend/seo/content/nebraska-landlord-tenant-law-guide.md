# Nebraska Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Nebraska Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/nebraska-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Understanding **Nebraska landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Cornhusker State. Whether you own rental units in Omaha, manage properties in Lincoln, or are a tenant in Grand Island, knowing the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Nebraska's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by the **Nebraska Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (NURLTA)**, codified in Nebraska Revised Statutes §76-1401 through §76-1449. This comprehensive statute establishes the core rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants throughout the state.

This guide covers the most important aspects of Nebraska landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. Whether you're a tenant seeking to understand your rights or a landlord working to maintain compliance, this article is your essential resource.

## Overview of Nebraska's Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act

The NURLTA, found in Nebraska Revised Statutes §76-1401 through §76-1449, provides a comprehensive framework for residential rental relationships in Nebraska. The Act applies to most residential rental agreements in the state, with limited exceptions for institutional housing and certain owner-occupied properties.

### Key Principles

The NURLTA establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and habitable
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith throughout the tenancy
*   Lease agreements cannot waive the protections provided by the Act
*   Retaliatory actions by landlords are prohibited

## Nebraska Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Nebraska's security deposit rules are outlined in Nebraska Revised Statutes §76-1416.

### Security Deposit Limit: 1 Month's Rent Maximum (No Pets)

Under Nebraska Revised Statutes §76-1416, Nebraska landlords may charge a security deposit of up to **one month's rent** if no pets are allowed. If pets are permitted, the landlord may collect an additional **pet deposit of up to one-quarter of one month's rent**, bringing the total maximum to **one and one-quarter months' rent**.

For example, if the monthly rent is $1,200, the maximum security deposit is $1,200 (no pets) or $1,500 (with pets). This limit includes all refundable deposits collected at the start of the tenancy.

### The 14-Day Return Rule

Under §76-1416, landlords must return the security deposit within **14 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the rental agreement terminates. If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with a written **itemized statement** of deductions within the same 14-day period.

The 14-day period begins when:

*   The tenant surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   All keys are returned to the landlord
*   The rental agreement has terminated

The landlord must mail the deposit and statement to the tenant's last known address or forwarding address.

### Permitted Deductions

Nebraska landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Cleaning costs** — To restore the unit to the condition at move-in, beyond normal wear and tear
4.  **Other lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches

Normal wear and tear — such as minor wall scuffs, small nail holes, gently worn carpet, and faded paint — cannot be deducted. Thorough documentation at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists is essential.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 14 days, the tenant may recover the full deposit amount. Under §76-1416, a landlord who wrongfully withholds a deposit may be liable for the amount wrongfully withheld plus court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Nebraska

One of the most fundamental tenant protections under Nebraska law is the right to a safe, habitable dwelling. Nebraska Revised Statutes §76-1419 outlines the landlord's maintenance obligations.

### Landlord Obligations Under §76-1419

Nebraska landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, and other systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Provide adequate heat during winter months
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal where applicable
*   Maintain appliances supplied or required by the lease agreement

### Tenant Maintenance Responsibilities Under §76-1421

Nebraska tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, or damage the property
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Allow the landlord reasonable access for repairs and inspections

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving written notice, tenants have several remedies under Nebraska law:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

Under §76-1425, tenants must first provide written notice to the landlord describing the condition that requires repair. The landlord generally has **14 days** to remedy the condition for non-emergency repairs.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

Under §76-1427, if the landlord fails to make essential repairs after proper notice, a tenant may contract for repairs and deduct the cost from rent. The repair cost generally may not exceed **one month's rent** or the actual cost, whichever is less.

#### 3. Rent Reduction

If the landlord's failure to maintain habitability materially affects the value of the rental unit, the tenant may be entitled to a reduction in rent proportional to the diminished value.

#### 4. Lease Termination

If the landlord fails to remedy a material health or safety violation within the required timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement under §76-1425. The tenant must provide written notice of termination.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit for breach of the habitability warranty, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can Nebraska Landlords Enter?

Nebraska law balances the landlord's need to access the property with the tenant's right to privacy and quiet enjoyment.

### The 24-Hour Notice Requirement

Under Nebraska Revised Statutes §76-1423, landlords must provide at least **24 hours' notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Entry must occur at reasonable times.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services
*   Other purposes permitted by the lease agreement

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as:

*   Fire or imminent danger to persons or property
*   Burst pipes, gas leaks, or other urgent maintenance issues
*   Reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the premises

If a landlord repeatedly enters without proper notice, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief and may recover damages under §76-1423.

## Eviction Process in Nebraska

Nebraska's eviction procedures are governed by Nebraska Revised Statutes §76-1431 through §76-1449 and Nebraska's forcible entry and detainer statutes (§25-21,219 through §25-21,235). Landlords must follow these procedures precisely — failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Nebraska landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Significant breaches of the lease agreement
3.  **Substantial damage to the property** — Willful or negligent destruction
4.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises, particularly drug-related offenses
5.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires without renewal

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper written notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **3-day notice** to pay or vacate (§76-1431(2))
*   **Material lease violation (curable)**: **14-day notice** to remedy; if not cured, the landlord may provide an additional **30-day notice** of termination (§76-1431(1))
*   **Repeated lease violations**: If the same violation recurs within **6 months**, the landlord may issue a **14-day unconditional notice** to vacate (§76-1431(1))
*   **Criminal activity / assault**: **5-day unconditional notice** to vacate (§76-1431(7))
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** (§76-1437)

### The Eviction Court Process (Forcible Entry and Detainer)

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the landlord can file a forcible entry and detainer action:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a complaint with the county court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 10 to 14 days
4.  **Trial**: Both parties present evidence
5.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Restitution**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of restitution, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Prohibited

Nebraska law strictly prohibits self-help evictions under §76-1430. Landlords cannot:

*   Change or remove locks
*   Shut off utilities (heat, water, electricity, gas)
*   Remove doors or windows
*   Remove tenant belongings without a court order

Violations can result in liability for actual damages plus up to **three months' periodic rent** and reasonable attorney's fees under §76-1430.

## Retaliation Protections Under §76-1439

Nebraska Revised Statutes §76-1439 protects tenants from retaliatory actions. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in retaliation for a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right granted by the NURLTA
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

If retaliatory conduct occurs within **one year** of a protected activity, it is presumed retaliatory. The landlord bears the burden of proving a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the action.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Nebraska

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Neither party is required to give notice of non-renewal unless the lease specifies otherwise. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement on the same terms.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before the end of a rental period under §76-1437.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or the NURLTA
*   Domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking (with proper documentation and a protection order)
*   Unit becomes uninhabitable due to casualty damage

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Nebraska landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property under §76-1432.
