# Idaho Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Idaho Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/idaho-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Understanding **Idaho landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Gem State. Whether you own rental units in Boise, manage properties in Idaho Falls, or are a tenant in Coeur d'Alene, knowing the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Idaho's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by **Idaho Code Title 6, Chapter 3** (§§6-301 through 6-324) and **Title 55, Chapter 2** (§§55-201 through 55-214). These statutes establish the core rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants across the state.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of Idaho landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. Whether you're a tenant seeking to understand your rights or a landlord working to maintain compliance, this article will serve as your essential resource.

## Overview of Idaho Landlord-Tenant Statutes

Idaho does not have a comprehensive Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act like many other states. Instead, the state relies on a combination of statutory provisions in Idaho Code Title 6, Chapter 3 (governing evictions and unlawful detainer) and Title 55, Chapter 2 (covering general landlord-tenant duties and lease requirements).

### Key Principles

Idaho's landlord-tenant statutes establish several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must maintain rental premises in a condition fit for habitation
*   Tenants must use the premises responsibly and pay rent as agreed
*   Both parties must comply with the terms of the lease agreement
*   Eviction must follow specific legal procedures — self-help is prohibited
*   Security deposits must be handled and returned according to statutory requirements

## Idaho Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are one of the most commonly disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Idaho's security deposit rules are found in Idaho Code §6-321.

### No Statutory Limit on Deposit Amount

**Idaho does not impose a statutory cap on the amount a landlord may collect as a security deposit.** This provides landlords flexibility to set deposit amounts based on property value, risk assessment, and local market conditions. However, charging an unreasonably high deposit may deter prospective tenants and could be scrutinized by a court.

Most Idaho landlords charge between one and two months' rent as a security deposit, which aligns with industry standards and tenant expectations.

### The 21-Day Return Rule (Up to 30 Days for Damages)

Under Idaho Code §6-321, landlords must return the security deposit within **21 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the lease terminates. If there is damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear, the landlord may take up to **30 days** to return the deposit, provided they furnish a written itemized statement of deductions.

The return timeline begins when:

*   The tenant surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   All keys are returned to the landlord
*   The lease has terminated

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with an **itemized statement** of deductions along with the remaining balance.

### Permitted Deductions

Idaho landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Cleaning costs** — To restore the unit to the condition at move-in (beyond normal wear)
4.  **Other lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches

Normal wear and tear — such as minor wall scuffs, small nail holes, gently worn carpet, and faded paint — cannot be deducted. Thorough documentation at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists is strongly recommended.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within the required timeframe, the tenant may take legal action to recover the deposit. Under Idaho Code §6-321, a landlord who acts in bad faith may be liable for up to **three times the amount wrongfully withheld**, plus court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Idaho

Idaho law requires landlords to maintain rental properties in a condition that is safe and fit for habitation. While Idaho's habitability standards are not as codified as some states, landlords still have clear obligations.

### Landlord Obligations

Under Idaho Code §6-320 and common law principles, Idaho landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes
*   Make repairs necessary to keep the premises in a habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, and ventilating systems in good working order
*   Provide running water and hot water
*   Ensure the structural integrity of the building (roof, walls, floors, windows)
*   Maintain supplied appliances in working order

### Tenant Maintenance Responsibilities

Idaho tenants have corresponding obligations under the lease and under general legal principles:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, and heating systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy property
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord
*   Comply with all building and housing codes applicable to tenants

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition, Idaho tenants have several remedies:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is always to notify the landlord in writing, describing the condition that requires repair. Idaho law expects tenants to give the landlord a reasonable opportunity to address the problem before pursuing other remedies.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

In certain circumstances, Idaho tenants may arrange for essential repairs and deduct the reasonable cost from rent. This remedy should only be used after the landlord has been given proper written notice and a reasonable time to make repairs. Document everything thoroughly.

#### 3. Lease Termination

If the landlord's failure to maintain habitability is material and continues after written notice, the tenant may have grounds to terminate the lease and vacate the premises.

#### 4. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief through the courts.

## Entry Rights: When Can Idaho Landlords Enter?

Idaho law addresses the landlord's right to access the property while respecting the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment.

### Notice Requirements

While Idaho does not have a specific statute mandating a set number of hours for entry notice, **24 hours' notice** is the generally accepted standard based on common law and standard lease provisions. Entry must occur at reasonable times.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services
*   Other purposes permitted by the lease

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without prior notice in genuine emergencies, such as:

*   Fire or imminent danger to persons or property
*   Burst pipes, gas leaks, or other urgent maintenance issues
*   Reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the premises

## Eviction Process in Idaho

Idaho's eviction procedures are governed by Idaho Code Title 6, Chapter 3 (§§6-301 through 6-324), which covers unlawful detainer actions. Landlords must follow these procedures precisely — failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Idaho landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Significant breaches of the lease agreement
3.  **Waste or nuisance** — Actions that damage or devalue the property
4.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises
5.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires without renewal
6.  **Using the property for unlawful purposes**

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper written notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **3-day notice** to pay or vacate (Idaho Code §6-303)
*   **Material lease violation or nuisance**: **3-day unconditional notice** to vacate (Idaho Code §6-303)
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** before the end of the rental period (Idaho Code §55-208)
*   **Week-to-week tenancy termination**: **7 days' written notice**

### The Eviction Court Process (Unlawful Detainer)

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the landlord can file an unlawful detainer action:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files an unlawful detainer complaint with the magistrate court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Answer**: The tenant has the opportunity to respond to the complaint
4.  **Trial**: The court schedules a trial, typically within a few weeks
5.  **Judgment**: The judge hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Restitution**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of restitution, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

Idaho law prohibits self-help evictions. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities (water, gas, electricity, heat)
*   Remove tenant belongings without a court order
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant

A landlord who engages in self-help eviction may be liable for actual damages, penalties, and attorney's fees.

## Retaliation Protections

Idaho law provides some protections against retaliatory actions by landlords, though the statutory protections are more limited than in some states. A landlord may not take adverse action against a tenant solely in response to the tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any legal right under Idaho law

Tenants who believe they are victims of retaliation should document all communications and consult with an attorney.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Idaho

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Neither party is required to give notice of non-renewal unless the lease specifies otherwise. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before the end of a rental period under Idaho Code §55-208. The notice should be in writing and delivered to the other party.

### Week-to-Week Tenancies

Week-to-week tenancies require **7 days' written notice** for termination.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease
*   Domestic violence situations (Idaho Code §6-321C provides specific protections)
*   Unit becomes uninhabitable due to casualty damage

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Idaho landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
