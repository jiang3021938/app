# Security Deposit Laws by State: 2026 Complete Guide

## Why Security Deposit Laws Matter

Security deposit disputes are the #1 cause of landlord-tenant litigation in the US. Every state has different rules about how much you can charge, how to hold the deposit, and when and how to return it. Violating these rules can result in penalties of 2-3x the deposit amount.

## Key Variations by State

Maximum deposit amounts range from 1 month's rent (California under AB 12) to unlimited (several states have no cap). Return timelines vary from 14 days (Hawaii, Vermont) to 60 days (Alabama). Some states require deposits to be held in separate interest-bearing accounts.

## Common Landlord Mistakes

The most frequent violations include: charging more than the state maximum, failing to return the deposit within the required timeline, not providing an itemized list of deductions, mixing deposit funds with personal accounts, and not conducting a move-in/move-out inspection.

## Protect Yourself

Use AI-powered lease analysis to verify your security deposit terms comply with your state's current laws. Regulations change frequently — for example, California's deposit cap dropped from 2x to 1x rent in 2024 and remains at 1x as of 2026. Staying current is essential.
