# Utah Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Utah Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/utah-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Navigating **Utah landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Beehive State. Whether you own rental units in Salt Lake City, manage properties in Provo, or are a tenant in St. George, understanding the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Utah's primary residential landlord-tenant statutes are found in **Utah Code Title 57, Chapter 17** (the Fit Premises Act) and **Title 57, Chapter 22** (the Utah Residential Landlord-Tenant Act). Together these statutes establish the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants throughout the state.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of Utah landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities under Utah law.

## Overview of Utah Landlord-Tenant Law

Utah's landlord-tenant framework is built on two primary statutes. The **Fit Premises Act (Title 57, Chapter 17)** focuses on the landlord's duty to maintain habitable housing, while the **Utah Residential Landlord-Tenant Act (Title 57, Chapter 22)** addresses the broader relationship between landlords and tenants including deposits, entry, and eviction.

### Key Principles

Utah landlord-tenant law establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and fit for habitation under the Fit Premises Act
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must honor the terms of the lease agreement
*   Lease agreements must comply with state law requirements
*   Retaliatory evictions are prohibited under §57-22-5.1

## Utah Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Utah's rules are outlined in Utah Code §57-17-3 and related provisions.

### Deposit Amount Limits

**Utah does not impose a statutory limit on security deposit amounts.** Landlords may charge whatever amount they deem appropriate. However, market competition and practical considerations typically keep deposits in the range of one to two months' rent. Unreasonably high deposits may be challenged in court as unconscionable.

There is no statutory requirement that the deposit be held in a separate account or that interest be paid on the deposit.

### The 30-Day Return Rule

Under Utah Code §57-17-3, landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the lease has terminated. This 30-day window applies to the return of the deposit or the delivery of an itemized statement of deductions.

The 30-day period begins when:

*   The tenant has vacated the premises
*   The lease term has ended or been properly terminated
*   The landlord has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with a **written notice** itemizing the deductions and the amount withheld for each item within the same 30-day period.

### Permitted Deductions

Utah landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Breach of lease terms** — Costs resulting from lease violations
4.  **Cleaning costs** — If the unit was not left in a reasonably clean condition comparable to move-in
5.  **Unpaid utilities** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, and fading paint — cannot be deducted. Document the condition of the unit thoroughly at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 30 days, the tenant may be entitled to recover the full deposit amount. Under Utah Code §57-17-5, the landlord may be held liable for the wrongfully withheld amount. In cases of bad faith, the court may award the tenant damages and attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Utah

Utah's **Fit Premises Act (Title 57, Chapter 17)** establishes the implied warranty of habitability, requiring landlords to provide and maintain rental units that are safe and fit for human habitation.

### Landlord Obligations Under the Fit Premises Act

Utah landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide adequate heating and cooling facilities
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Maintain the structural integrity of the building, including roofs, walls, and foundations

### Tenant's Maintenance Responsibilities

Under Utah Code §57-22-3, tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, damage, or remove any part of the premises
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving notice, tenants have several remedies under the Fit Premises Act:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is always to notify the landlord in writing. Under Utah Code §57-22-6, the tenant must give the landlord written notice specifying the deficient conditions. The landlord generally has a **reasonable time** to remedy the condition.

#### 2. Rent Withholding

Under Utah Code §57-17-4, if the landlord fails to correct conditions that materially affect health and safety after proper notice, the tenant may be entitled to rent abatement for the period during which the premises were uninhabitable.

#### 3. Repair and Deduct

In certain situations, tenants may arrange for repairs and deduct the cost from rent, provided they follow proper notice procedures.

#### 4. Termination of Lease

If the landlord fails to address a material health or safety violation within a reasonable timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement with written notice under §57-22-6.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit against the landlord for breach of the Fit Premises Act, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can Utah Landlords Enter?

Utah Code §57-22-4 addresses landlord entry, balancing the landlord's property rights with the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment.

### 24-Hour Notice Requirement

Under §57-22-4, landlords must provide at least **24 hours' written notice** before entering a rental unit. The notice must specify the date and approximate time of entry.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Performing maintenance
*   Other purposes agreed upon by both parties

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, gas leaks, burst pipes, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property. Landlords may also enter if they reasonably believe the tenant has abandoned the premises.

## Eviction Process in Utah

Utah's eviction procedures are governed by Utah Code Title 78A, Chapter 6 (Utah Rules of Civil Procedure) and §78B-6-802 through §78B-6-816. Landlords must follow these procedures precisely; failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Utah landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Breaches of significant lease terms
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
5.  **Health or safety violations** — Tenant actions that endanger the property or other tenants
6.  **Nuisance** — Conduct that substantially interferes with other tenants

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: A **3-day notice** to pay or vacate under §78B-6-802
*   **Material lease violation (curable)**: **3-day notice** to comply or vacate
*   **Criminal activity or nuisance**: **3-day unconditional notice** to vacate
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **15 days' written notice** before the end of the rental period under §78B-6-802
*   **Holdover tenancy**: **5-day notice** to vacate after lease expiration

### The Eviction Court Process

If the tenant does not comply with the notice, the landlord can file an eviction action (unlawful detainer) in district court:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files an unlawful detainer complaint with the district court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules an expedited hearing, typically within 10 days
4.  **Judgment**: The judge hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
5.  **Order of Restitution**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues an order of restitution, and the constable or sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

Utah law prohibits self-help evictions. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant

Violations can result in liability for actual damages plus additional penalties.

## Retaliation Protections

Under Utah Code §57-22-5.1, landlords are prohibited from retaliating against tenants for exercising their legal rights. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in response to a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right under the Fit Premises Act
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

If a landlord takes adverse action within a certain timeframe after the tenant exercises a protected right, a rebuttable presumption of retaliation may arise.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Utah

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement under Utah common law.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **15 days' written notice** before termination under §78B-6-802.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or the Fit Premises Act
*   Domestic violence situations (under Utah Code §57-22-5.1)
*   Uninhabitable conditions that the landlord refuses to remedy

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Utah landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
