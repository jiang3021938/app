# South Carolina Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![South Carolina Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/south-carolina-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Navigating **South Carolina landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Palmetto State. Whether you own rental units in Charleston, manage properties in Columbia, or are a tenant in Greenville, understanding the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

South Carolina's primary residential landlord-tenant statute is the **South Carolina Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (SCRLTA)**, codified in South Carolina Code §27-40-10 through §27-40-940. This act applies to most residential rental agreements and provides the baseline rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants throughout the state.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of South Carolina landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities under South Carolina law.

## Overview of the South Carolina Residential Landlord and Tenant Act

The SCRLTA, found in South Carolina Code §27-40, establishes a comprehensive framework for residential rental relationships. It applies to most residential rental agreements in the state, with limited exceptions for transient occupancy in hotels and motels, residence at institutions, and arrangements where the occupant is a member of a fraternal or social organization occupying space in a structure operated for the benefit of the organization.

### Key Principles

The Act establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and habitable
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith throughout the tenancy
*   Lease agreements cannot waive the protections provided by the Act
*   Retaliatory actions by landlords are prohibited

## South Carolina Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. South Carolina's rules are outlined in South Carolina Code §27-40-410.

### No Statutory Limit on Deposit Amount

**South Carolina does not impose a statutory limit on the amount a landlord can collect as a security deposit**. This gives landlords flexibility to set deposit amounts based on property value, risk assessment, and market conditions. However, charging an unreasonably high deposit may deter prospective tenants and could face scrutiny in court.

Most South Carolina landlords charge between one and two months' rent as a security deposit, which aligns with industry norms and tenant expectations.

### The 30-Day Return Rule

Under South Carolina Code §27-40-410(a), landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the tenancy has terminated. This 30-day window applies to the return of the deposit or the delivery of an itemized statement of deductions.

The 30-day period begins when the tenant:

*   Surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   Returns all keys to the landlord
*   The tenancy has been properly terminated

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with an **itemized written statement** describing the amounts withheld and the reasons for withholding, along with the remaining balance.

### Permitted Deductions

South Carolina landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy, including any accelerated rent properly charged
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Breach of lease terms** — Costs resulting from lease violations
4.  **Cleaning costs** — If the unit was not left in a reasonably clean condition
5.  **Unpaid utilities** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, and fading paint — cannot be deducted. Document the condition of the unit thoroughly at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 30 days, the landlord forfeits the right to withhold any portion of the deposit. Under §27-40-410(b), the tenant may recover the full deposit plus any amounts wrongfully withheld. In cases of bad faith, the tenant may also recover up to **three times the amount wrongfully withheld** plus reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in South Carolina

One of the most fundamental tenant protections under the SCRLTA is the right to a safe, habitable dwelling. South Carolina Code §27-40-440 outlines the landlord's maintenance obligations.

### Landlord Obligations Under §27-40-440

South Carolina landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water at all times
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal where applicable
*   Maintain appliances and facilities supplied or required to be supplied by the landlord
*   Provide working locks and keys for all exterior doors and windows

### Tenant's Maintenance Responsibilities

Under South Carolina Code §27-40-510, tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage, rubbish, and other waste in a clean and safe manner
*   Use electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, damage, impair, or remove any part of the premises
*   Comply with all applicable building and housing codes
*   Conduct themselves in a manner that does not disturb other tenants' peaceful enjoyment

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving written notice, tenants have several remedies under the SCRLTA:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is always to notify the landlord in writing. Under §27-40-610, the landlord generally has **14 days** to remedy a non-emergency condition after receiving written notice. For conditions that pose an imminent threat to health or safety, the timeframe may be shorter.

#### 2. Termination of Lease

If the landlord fails to address a material health or safety violation within the required timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement under §27-40-610(a). The tenant must provide written notice of termination.

#### 3. Repair and Deduct

South Carolina does not have a broad statutory "repair and deduct" remedy. Tenants should generally pursue other remedies such as rent abatement, lease termination, or court action rather than making unauthorized deductions from rent.

#### 4. Rent Abatement

If the landlord's failure to maintain the premises materially affects health and safety, the tenant may seek a court-ordered reduction in rent proportionate to the diminished rental value.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit against the landlord for breach of the habitability warranty, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can South Carolina Landlords Enter?

South Carolina law balances the landlord's need to access the property with the tenant's right to privacy.

### Notice Requirements Under §27-40-530

Under the SCRLTA, landlords must provide **24 hours' notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Entry must occur at reasonable times.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs, decorations, alterations, or improvements
*   Supplying necessary or agreed-upon services
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, lenders, or contractors
*   Other purposes agreed upon by both parties

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, gas leaks, burst pipes, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property. Landlords may also enter if they reasonably believe the tenant has abandoned the premises.

## Eviction Process in South Carolina

South Carolina's eviction procedures are governed by the SCRLTA and South Carolina's ejectment and summary eviction statutes. Landlords must follow these procedures precisely; failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

South Carolina landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Breaches of significant lease terms
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on or near the premises
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
5.  **Health or safety violations** — Tenant actions that endanger the property or other tenants

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **5-day notice** to pay or vacate (§27-40-710(B))
*   **Material lease violation (first offense)**: **14-day notice** to remedy or vacate (§27-40-710(A))
*   **Repeated lease violations**: **14-day unconditional notice** to vacate if the same or similar violation occurs within six months of a prior notice (§27-40-710(A))
*   **Criminal activity**: May be subject to expedited or immediate termination procedures
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** (§27-40-770)

### The Eviction Court Process

If the tenant does not comply with the notice, the landlord can file an eviction action in magistrate's court:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a rule to show cause or ejectment action with the magistrate's court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 7–14 days
4.  **Judgment**: The judge hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
5.  **Writ of Ejectment**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of ejectment, and the sheriff or constable can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

South Carolina law strictly prohibits self-help evictions under §27-40-660. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant

Violations can result in liability for actual damages, plus up to **three months' periodic rent**, and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Retaliation Protections

South Carolina Code §27-40-910 protects tenants from retaliatory actions by landlords. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in response to a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right granted by the SCRLTA
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

If retaliatory action occurs within a reasonable period following a protected activity, the tenant may raise retaliation as a defense to eviction and may recover damages plus reasonable attorney's fees.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in South Carolina

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Neither party is required to give notice of non-renewal unless the lease specifies otherwise. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before termination under §27-40-770.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or the SCRLTA
*   Domestic violence situations (under South Carolina Code §27-40-530.1)
*   Uninhabitable conditions that the landlord refuses to remedy

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. South Carolina landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property under §27-40-730(C).
