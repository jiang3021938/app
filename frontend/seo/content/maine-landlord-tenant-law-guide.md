Whether you own rental units in Portland, manage properties in Bangor, or are a tenant in Augusta, knowing the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Maine's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by **Maine Revised Statutes Title 14, Chapter 710** (§§6001 through 6046). This statutory framework provides comprehensive protections for both landlords and tenants, covering everything from security deposits to eviction procedures.

This guide covers the most important aspects of Maine landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. Whether you're a tenant seeking to understand your rights or a landlord working to maintain compliance, this article will serve as your essential resource.

## Overview of Maine Landlord-Tenant Law

Maine's landlord-tenant framework, found in Title 14, Chapter 710 of the Maine Revised Statutes, provides detailed rules governing residential rental relationships. The statutes apply to most residential rental agreements in the state.

### Key Principles

Maine's landlord-tenant law establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and habitable
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must comply with the terms of the lease and applicable statutes
*   Lease agreements cannot waive certain statutory protections
*   Retaliatory actions by landlords are prohibited
*   Security deposits must be handled according to specific statutory requirements

## Maine Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Maine's security deposit rules are outlined in Maine Revised Statutes Title 14, §6031 through §6038.

### Security Deposit Limit: 2 Months' Rent Maximum

Under Title 14, §6032, Maine landlords may charge a security deposit of up to **two months' rent**. This is a hard cap that applies statewide.

For example, if the monthly rent is $1,400, the maximum security deposit is $2,800. This limit includes all refundable deposits collected at the start of the tenancy, regardless of how they are labeled.

### The 30-Day Return Rule (21 Days With Written Statement)

Under Title 14, §6033, landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the tenancy terminates. However, if the landlord provides a **written statement** of the reasons for any deduction within **21 days**, the remaining deposit must accompany that statement.

The return period begins when:

*   The tenant surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   All keys are returned to the landlord
*   The tenancy has terminated

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with a written **itemized statement** describing each deduction, together with the remaining balance.

### Where Deposits Must Be Held

Maine law requires landlords to hold security deposits in accordance with specific requirements. Under §6038, the landlord must inform the tenant of the name and location of the institution where the deposit is being held.

### Permitted Deductions

Maine landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Cleaning costs** — To restore the unit to the condition at move-in, beyond normal wear
4.  **Other lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented breaches of the lease

Normal wear and tear — such as minor wall scuffs, small nail holes, gently worn carpet, and faded paint — cannot be deducted. Thorough documentation with dated photos at move-in and move-out is strongly recommended.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within the required timeframe, the consequences can be significant. Under Title 14, §6035, a landlord who wrongfully withholds a deposit may be liable for:

*   The full deposit amount
*   **Double the amount wrongfully withheld** in cases of bad faith
*   Reasonable attorney's fees and court costs

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Maine

Maine law provides robust protections for tenants' right to safe, habitable housing. The implied warranty of habitability is established under Title 14, §6021.

### Landlord Obligations Under Maine Law

Under Title 14, §6021 and related provisions, Maine landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and other systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water at all times
*   Provide adequate heat during cold months
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal where applicable
*   Maintain the structural integrity of the building (roof, walls, windows, floors)
*   Maintain supplied appliances in working order

### Tenant Maintenance Responsibilities

Maine tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, or damage the property
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Allow the landlord reasonable access for repairs and inspections
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition, Maine tenants have several remedies:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is to provide written notice to the landlord describing the condition that requires repair. Maine law expects tenants to give the landlord a reasonable opportunity to remedy the condition before pursuing other options.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

Under Maine law, if the landlord fails to make essential repairs after proper notice, tenants may arrange for repairs and deduct the reasonable cost from rent. This remedy should be used carefully and only after proper notice and documentation.

#### 3. Rent Escrow

Maine allows tenants to deposit rent into an escrow account with the court when a landlord fails to maintain habitability. Under Title 14, §6001 et seq., tenants may petition the court for permission to escrow rent until the landlord makes required repairs.

#### 4. Lease Termination

If the landlord's failure to maintain habitability is material, the tenant may have grounds to terminate the lease and vacate the premises.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief. Maine courts have been protective of tenant habitability rights.

## Entry Rights: When Can Maine Landlords Enter?

Maine law addresses the landlord's right to access the property while respecting the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment.

### The 24-Hour Notice Requirement

Under Title 14, §6025, landlords must provide at least **24 hours' notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Entry must occur at reasonable times.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services
*   Under court order

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as:

*   Fire or imminent danger to persons or property
*   Burst pipes, gas leaks, or other urgent maintenance issues
*   Reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the premises

If a landlord repeatedly enters without proper notice, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief and may recover damages.

## Eviction Process in Maine

Maine's eviction procedures are governed by Title 14, §§6001 through 6046. Maine calls its eviction process a **"Forcible Entry and Detainer" (FED)** action. Landlords must follow these procedures precisely — failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Maine landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Significant breaches of the lease agreement
3.  **Damage to the property** — Willful or negligent destruction
4.  **Nuisance behavior** — Actions that substantially interfere with other tenants' quiet enjoyment
5.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires without renewal
6.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper written notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **7-day notice** to pay or vacate (Title 14, §6002)
*   **Material lease violation**: **7-day notice** to vacate (Title 14, §6002)
*   **Tenancy at will (no written lease) termination**: **30 days' written notice** (Title 14, §6002)
*   **Imminent danger / serious criminal activity**: **7-day unconditional notice** to vacate

### The Eviction Court Process (Forcible Entry and Detainer)

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the landlord can file an FED action:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files an FED complaint with the district court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint at least **7 days** before the hearing
3.  **Mediation**: Maine courts may offer or require mediation before trial
4.  **Hearing/Trial**: Both parties present evidence and arguments
5.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Possession**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of possession, and the sheriff can remove the tenant after the applicable appeal period

### Self-Help Evictions Are Prohibited

Maine law strictly prohibits self-help evictions under Title 14, §6014. Landlords cannot:

*   Change or remove locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities (water, gas, electricity, heat)
*   Remove tenant belongings without a court order
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant
*   Remove doors or windows

Violations can result in liability for actual damages, **statutory damages of not less than $250**, and reasonable attorney's fees under Title 14, §6014.

## Retaliation Protections Under Title 14, §6001

Maine Revised Statutes Title 14, §6001 provides strong protections against retaliatory actions by landlords. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, threaten eviction, or take any other retaliatory action against a tenant for:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency or court
*   Exercising any legal right under Maine law
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association
*   Testifying in court proceedings related to housing conditions

If retaliatory conduct occurs within **six months** of a protected activity, it is presumed retaliatory. The landlord bears the burden of proving a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the action.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Maine

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord accepts rent, the tenancy typically converts to a **tenancy at will** (month-to-month).

### Tenancy at Will (Month-to-Month)

For tenancies at will, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before termination under Title 14, §6002.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or statutory obligations
*   Domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking (Title 14, §6002-A provides specific protections requiring documentation such as a court order or law enforcement report)
*   Unit becomes uninhabitable due to fire or casualty damage

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Maine landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
