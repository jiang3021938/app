# Nevada Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Nevada Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/nevada-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Understanding **Nevada landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Silver State. Whether you own rental units in Las Vegas, manage properties in Reno, or are a tenant in Henderson, knowing the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Nevada's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by **Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 118A** (Landlord and Tenant — Dwellings). This comprehensive statute establishes the core rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants throughout the state.

This guide covers the most important aspects of Nevada landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. Whether you're a tenant seeking to understand your rights or a landlord working to maintain compliance, this article is your essential resource.

## Overview of Nevada's Landlord and Tenant Statute

NRS Chapter 118A provides a comprehensive framework for residential rental relationships in Nevada. The statute applies to most residential rental agreements in the state, with limited exceptions for institutional housing, hotels, and certain transient occupancies.

### Key Principles

NRS Chapter 118A establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and habitable
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith throughout the tenancy
*   Lease agreements cannot waive the protections provided by the statute
*   Retaliatory actions by landlords are prohibited

## Nevada Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Nevada's security deposit rules are outlined in NRS §118A.242.

### Security Deposit Limit: 3 Months' Rent Maximum

Under NRS §118A.242, Nevada landlords may charge a security deposit of up to **three months' rent**. This is a hard cap that applies statewide.

For example, if the monthly rent is $1,500, the maximum security deposit is $4,500. This limit includes all refundable deposits collected at the start of the tenancy, regardless of how they are labeled (e.g., "pet deposit," "cleaning deposit").

### The 30-Day Return Rule

Under NRS §118A.242, landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the rental agreement terminates. If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with a written **itemized statement** of deductions within the same 30-day period.

The 30-day period begins when:

*   The tenant surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   All keys are returned to the landlord
*   The rental agreement has terminated

The landlord must mail the deposit and statement to the tenant's last known address or forwarding address.

### Permitted Deductions

Nevada landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Cleaning costs** — To restore the unit to the condition at move-in, beyond normal wear and tear
4.  **Utility charges** — Unpaid utility bills that are the tenant's responsibility
5.  **Other lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches

Normal wear and tear — such as minor wall scuffs, small nail holes, gently worn carpet, and faded paint — cannot be deducted. Thorough documentation at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists is essential.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 30 days, the tenant may recover the full deposit amount. Under NRS §118A.242, a landlord who wrongfully withholds a deposit may be liable for the entire deposit amount, plus court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Nevada

One of the most fundamental tenant protections under Nevada law is the right to a safe, habitable dwelling. NRS §118A.290 outlines the landlord's maintenance obligations.

### Landlord Obligations Under §118A.290

Nevada landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, and other systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Provide adequate heat and cooling
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal where applicable
*   Maintain appliances supplied or required by the lease agreement
*   Provide functioning smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors

### Tenant Maintenance Responsibilities Under §118A.310

Nevada tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, or damage the property
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Allow the landlord reasonable access for repairs and inspections

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving written notice, tenants have several remedies under Nevada law:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

Under NRS §118A.355, tenants must first provide written notice to the landlord describing the condition that requires repair. The landlord generally has **14 days** to remedy the condition for non-emergency repairs, or **48 hours** for conditions that materially affect health and safety.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

Under NRS §118A.360, if the landlord fails to make essential repairs after proper notice, a tenant may contract for repairs and deduct the cost from rent. The repair cost may not exceed **one month's rent** or the actual reasonable cost.

#### 3. Rent Reduction

If the landlord's failure to maintain habitability materially affects the value of the rental unit, the tenant may be entitled to a reduction in rent proportional to the diminished value.

#### 4. Lease Termination

If the landlord fails to remedy a material health or safety violation within the required timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement under NRS §118A.355. The tenant must provide written notice of termination.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit for breach of the habitability warranty, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can Nevada Landlords Enter?

Nevada law balances the landlord's need to access the property with the tenant's right to privacy and quiet enjoyment.

### The 24-Hour Notice Requirement

Under NRS §118A.330, landlords must provide at least **24 hours' notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Entry must occur at reasonable times.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services
*   Other purposes permitted by the lease agreement

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as:

*   Fire or imminent danger to persons or property
*   Burst pipes, gas leaks, or other urgent maintenance issues
*   Reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the premises

If a landlord repeatedly enters without proper notice, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief and may recover damages under NRS §118A.330.

## Eviction Process in Nevada

Nevada's eviction procedures are governed by NRS Chapter 118A and NRS Chapter 40 (Actions and Proceedings in Particular Cases Concerning Real Property). Landlords must follow these procedures precisely — failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Nevada landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Significant breaches of the lease agreement
3.  **Substantial damage to the property** — Willful or negligent destruction
4.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises, particularly drug-related offenses
5.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires without renewal
6.  **Nuisance activity** — Conduct that substantially interferes with other tenants' comfort or safety

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper written notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **7 judicial days' notice** to pay or vacate (NRS §40.253)
*   **Material lease violation (curable)**: **5-day notice** to cure or vacate (NRS §40.2516)
*   **Nuisance / criminal activity**: **3-day unconditional notice** to vacate (NRS §40.2514)
*   **Lease violation (non-curable)**: **5-day unconditional notice** to vacate (NRS §40.2516)
*   **Holdover tenancy**: **5-day notice** to quit
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** (NRS §40.251)
*   **Week-to-week tenancy termination**: **7 days' written notice**

### The Eviction Court Process (Summary Eviction / Unlawful Detainer)

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the landlord can file for eviction:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files an affidavit for summary eviction or an unlawful detainer complaint with the justice court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the notice and court documents
3.  **Hearing**: For summary evictions, the tenant may file an affidavit to contest; the court schedules a hearing if contested
4.  **Trial**: Both parties present evidence
5.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
6.  **Order of Eviction**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues an order of removal, and the constable can remove the tenant, typically within **24 hours** of the order

### Self-Help Evictions Are Prohibited

Nevada law strictly prohibits self-help evictions under NRS §118A.390. Landlords cannot:

*   Change or remove locks
*   Shut off utilities (heat, water, electricity, gas)
*   Remove doors or windows
*   Remove tenant belongings without a court order

Violations can result in liability for actual damages plus an amount not to exceed the greater of **$2,500 or actual damages**, plus court costs and reasonable attorney's fees under NRS §118A.390.

## Retaliation Protections Under §118A.510

NRS §118A.510 protects tenants from retaliatory actions. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in retaliation for a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right granted by NRS Chapter 118A
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

If retaliatory conduct occurs within a reasonable period of a protected activity, it is presumed retaliatory. The landlord bears the burden of proving a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the action.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Nevada

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Neither party is required to give notice of non-renewal unless the lease specifies otherwise. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement on the same terms.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before the end of a rental period under NRS §40.251.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or NRS Chapter 118A
*   Domestic violence situations (NRS §118A.345 provides specific protections)
*   Unit becomes uninhabitable due to casualty damage
*   Tenant is 60 years of age or older and relocating to a residential facility for older adults

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Nevada landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
