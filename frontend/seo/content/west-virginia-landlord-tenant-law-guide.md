By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities under West Virginia law.

## Overview of West Virginia Landlord-Tenant Law

West Virginia's landlord-tenant framework is primarily found in W. Va. Code Chapter 37, Article 6A. The state's statutory framework provides a moderate level of tenant protections, with specific requirements governing security deposits, habitability, and the eviction process.

### Key Principles

West Virginia landlord-tenant law establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and fit for habitation
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must honor the terms of the lease agreement
*   Lease agreements must comply with state law requirements
*   Retaliatory evictions are prohibited under §37-6A-1 et seq.

## West Virginia Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. West Virginia's rules are outlined in W. Va. Code §37-6A-1 through §37-6A-6.

### Deposit Amount Limits

**West Virginia does not impose a statutory limit on security deposit amounts.** Landlords may charge whatever amount they deem appropriate. However, market competition and practical considerations typically keep deposits in the range of one to two months' rent. Courts may consider unreasonably high deposits to be unconscionable.

There is no statutory requirement that the deposit be held in a separate account, but landlords must handle deposits in compliance with the return requirements.

### The 60-Day Return Rule

Under W. Va. Code §37-6A-1, landlords must return the security deposit within **60 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the lease has terminated. This 60-day window applies to the return of the deposit or the delivery of an itemized statement of deductions.

The 60-day period begins when:

*   The tenant has vacated the premises
*   The lease term has ended or been properly terminated
*   The landlord has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with an **itemized written statement** detailing each deduction and the amount withheld for each item within the 60-day period.

### Permitted Deductions

West Virginia landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Breach of lease terms** — Costs resulting from lease violations
4.  **Cleaning costs** — If the unit was not left in a reasonably clean condition
5.  **Unpaid utilities** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, and fading paint — cannot be deducted. Document the condition of the unit thoroughly at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 60 days, the tenant may be entitled to recover the full deposit amount. Under W. Va. Code §37-6A-1, the landlord may be liable for the wrongfully withheld amount. In cases of bad faith or willful noncompliance, the tenant may recover damages and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in West Virginia

West Virginia recognizes the implied warranty of habitability, requiring landlords to provide and maintain rental units that are safe and fit for human habitation under the common law and statutory provisions.

### Landlord Obligations Under West Virginia Law

West Virginia landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, and ventilating systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide adequate heating facilities capable of maintaining a reasonable temperature
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Maintain the structural integrity of the building, including roofs, walls, and foundations
*   Maintain smoke detectors in working order

### Tenant's Maintenance Responsibilities

Under West Virginia law, tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, damage, or remove any part of the premises
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving notice, tenants have several remedies:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is always to notify the landlord in writing. The landlord should be given a reasonable time to remedy the condition, typically **14 days** for non-emergency conditions. For conditions that pose an imminent threat to health or safety, shorter notice may be appropriate.

#### 2. Rent Withholding

Under West Virginia case law (Teller v. McCoy, 162 W. Va. 367), if the landlord fails to correct conditions that materially affect health and safety after proper notice, the tenant may withhold rent until the repairs are made.

#### 3. Repair and Deduct

In certain circumstances, West Virginia tenants may arrange for necessary repairs and deduct the reasonable cost from rent after proper notice and the landlord's failure to act.

#### 4. Termination of Lease

If the landlord fails to address a material health or safety violation within a reasonable timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement with written notice.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit against the landlord for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can West Virginia Landlords Enter?

West Virginia law provides general guidelines on landlord entry, balancing the landlord's property rights with the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment.

### Reasonable Notice Requirement

West Virginia does not have a specific statute mandating a set number of hours for advance notice. However, landlords are generally expected to provide **reasonable notice** before entering a rental unit. In practice, most courts and legal practitioners consider **24 hours** to be reasonable notice.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Addressing emergency situations
*   Other purposes agreed upon by both parties

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, gas leaks, burst pipes, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property. Landlords may also enter if they reasonably believe the tenant has abandoned the premises.

## Eviction Process in West Virginia

West Virginia's eviction procedures are governed by W. Va. Code Chapter 55, Article 3A (Wrongful Occupation of Residential Rental Property) and related statutes. Landlords must follow these procedures precisely; failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

West Virginia landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Breaches of significant lease terms
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises, including drug-related activity
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
5.  **Health or safety violations** — Tenant actions that endanger the property or other tenants
6.  **Damage to property** — Substantial damage to the rental unit

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: Landlord is not required to provide a cure period under W. Va. Code §55-3A-1 if the lease has expired; otherwise a reasonable notice to pay or vacate is standard practice
*   **Material lease violation**: Written notice giving the tenant an opportunity to cure
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **One month's written notice** before the end of the rental period under §37-6-5
*   **Criminal activity or drug-related offense**: Immediate action may be available under §55-3A-1

### The Eviction Court Process

If the tenant does not comply with the notice, the landlord can file an eviction action in magistrate court:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a complaint for wrongful occupation with the magistrate court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 10–20 days
4.  **Judgment**: The magistrate hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
5.  **Order of Possession**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues an order of possession, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

West Virginia law prohibits self-help evictions. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant

Violations can result in liability for actual damages plus additional penalties.

## Retaliation Protections

West Virginia law disfavors retaliatory actions by landlords. A landlord should not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in response to a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any legal right
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

Tenants may raise retaliation as a defense to eviction if they can demonstrate the landlord's action was motivated by the tenant's exercise of a protected right.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in West Virginia

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **one month's written notice** before termination under W. Va. Code §37-6-5.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or habitability obligations
*   Domestic violence situations (under W. Va. Code §48-28-5)
*   Uninhabitable conditions that the landlord refuses to remedy

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. West Virginia landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
