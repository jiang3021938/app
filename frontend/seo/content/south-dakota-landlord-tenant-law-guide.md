![South Dakota Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/south-dakota-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Navigating **South Dakota landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Mount Rushmore State. Whether you own rental units in Sioux Falls, manage properties in Rapid City, or are a tenant in Aberdeen, understanding the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

South Dakota's primary residential landlord-tenant statutes are found in **South Dakota Codified Laws (SDCL) Chapter 43-32**, which governs the general landlord and tenant relationship. These laws apply to most residential rental agreements and provide the baseline rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of South Dakota landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities under South Dakota law.

## Overview of South Dakota Landlord-Tenant Law

South Dakota's landlord-tenant framework is primarily found in SDCL Chapter 43-32. The state has not adopted the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA), so the statutory framework is more limited than in some states, placing greater importance on the lease agreement itself.

### Key Principles

South Dakota landlord-tenant law establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and fit for habitation
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must honor the terms of the lease agreement
*   Lease agreements must comply with state law requirements
*   Security deposit handling must follow strict statutory procedures

## South Dakota Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. South Dakota's rules are outlined in SDCL §43-32-6.1 through §43-32-24.

### Deposit Amount Limits

Under SDCL §43-32-6.1, **South Dakota limits security deposits to one month's rent**. However, if the tenant has a pet, the landlord may charge up to **two months' rent** as a security deposit. This pet exception is one of the clearest statutory provisions in South Dakota's deposit law.

There is no statutory requirement that the deposit be held in a separate account or that interest be paid on the deposit.

### The 14-Day Return Rule

Under SDCL §43-32-24, landlords must return the security deposit within **14 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the lease has terminated. However, if the landlord provides **written notice of deductions**, the return period extends to **45 days**.

The return period begins when:

*   The tenant has vacated the premises
*   The lease term has ended or been properly terminated
*   The landlord has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with an **itemized written statement** detailing each deduction and the amount withheld for each item.

### Permitted Deductions

South Dakota landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Breach of lease terms** — Costs resulting from lease violations
4.  **Cleaning costs** — If the unit was not left in a reasonably clean condition
5.  **Unpaid utilities** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, and fading paint — cannot be deducted. Document the condition of the unit thoroughly at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within the required timeframe, the tenant may be entitled to recover the full deposit amount. Under SDCL §43-32-24, if the landlord willfully fails to comply, the tenant may recover up to **two times the amount wrongfully withheld** plus reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in South Dakota

South Dakota recognizes an implied warranty of habitability, requiring landlords to provide and maintain rental units that are safe and fit for human habitation.

### Landlord Obligations Under SDCL Chapter 43-32

South Dakota landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, and ventilating systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide adequate heating facilities capable of maintaining a reasonable temperature
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Maintain the structural integrity of the building, including roofs, walls, and foundations

### Tenant's Maintenance Responsibilities

Under South Dakota law, tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, damage, or remove any part of the premises
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving notice, tenants have several remedies:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is always to notify the landlord in writing. The landlord should be given a reasonable time to remedy the condition, typically **14 days** for non-emergency conditions. For conditions that pose an imminent threat to health or safety, shorter notice may be appropriate.

#### 2. Termination of Lease

Under SDCL §43-32-9, if the landlord fails to address a material health or safety violation within a reasonable timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement with written notice.

#### 3. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit against the landlord for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can South Dakota Landlords Enter?

South Dakota law provides general guidelines on landlord entry, balancing the landlord's property rights with the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment.

### Reasonable Notice Requirement

South Dakota does not have a specific statute mandating a set number of hours for advance notice. However, landlords are generally expected to provide **reasonable notice** before entering a rental unit. In practice, most courts and legal practitioners consider **24 hours** to be reasonable notice.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Addressing emergency situations
*   Other purposes agreed upon by both parties

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, gas leaks, burst pipes, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property. Landlords may also enter if they reasonably believe the tenant has abandoned the premises.

## Eviction Process in South Dakota

South Dakota's eviction procedures are governed by SDCL Chapter 21-16 (Forcible Entry and Detainer) and related provisions. Landlords must follow these procedures precisely; failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

South Dakota landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Breaches of significant lease terms
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
5.  **Health or safety violations** — Tenant actions that endanger the property or other tenants

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: A **3-day notice** to pay or vacate under SDCL §21-16-1
*   **Material lease violation**: Written notice giving the tenant an opportunity to cure, typically within a **reasonable timeframe**
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **One full rental period** written notice (typically 30 days) under SDCL §43-32-13
*   **Breach of conditions**: Written notice specifying the breach and allowing the tenant to remedy it

### The Eviction Court Process

If the tenant does not comply with the notice, the landlord can file an eviction action in circuit court:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a complaint for forcible entry and detainer with the circuit court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint at least **3 days** before the hearing
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 3–10 days
4.  **Judgment**: The judge hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
5.  **Writ of Restitution**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of restitution, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

South Dakota law prohibits self-help evictions. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant

Violations can result in liability for actual damages plus additional penalties.

## Retaliation Protections

While South Dakota does not have an extensive statutory retaliation provision, courts generally disfavor retaliatory evictions. A landlord should not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in response to a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any legal right
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

Tenants may raise retaliation as a defense to eviction if they can demonstrate the landlord's action was motivated by the tenant's exercise of a protected right.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in South Dakota

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Under SDCL §43-32-13, if the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **one full rental period** written notice before termination under SDCL §43-32-13. In practice, this is typically **30 days**.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or habitability obligations
*   Domestic violence situations (under SDCL §43-32-28)
*   Uninhabitable conditions that the landlord refuses to remedy

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. South Dakota landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
