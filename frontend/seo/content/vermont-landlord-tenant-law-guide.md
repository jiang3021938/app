![Vermont Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/vermont-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Navigating **Vermont landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Green Mountain State. Whether you own rental units in Burlington, manage properties in Montpelier, or are a tenant in Rutland, understanding the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Vermont's primary residential landlord-tenant statutes are found in **Vermont Statutes Title 9, Chapter 137** (Residential Rental Agreements). These laws apply to most residential rental agreements and provide comprehensive rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of Vermont landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities under Vermont law.

## Overview of Vermont Landlord-Tenant Law

Vermont's landlord-tenant framework is primarily found in Title 9, Chapter 137 (§§4451–4469a). Vermont provides some of the strongest tenant protections in the country, with detailed statutory requirements for landlords regarding habitability, security deposits, and the eviction process.

### Key Principles

Vermont landlord-tenant law establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and fit for habitation
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must honor the terms of the lease agreement
*   Lease agreements must comply with state law requirements
*   Retaliatory evictions are expressly prohibited under §4465

## Vermont Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Vermont's rules are outlined in 9 V.S.A. §4461.

### Deposit Amount Limits

**Vermont does not impose a statutory limit on security deposit amounts.** Landlords may charge whatever amount they deem appropriate. However, market competition and practical considerations typically keep deposits in the range of one to two months' rent. Courts may scrutinize unreasonably high deposits.

There is no statutory requirement that the deposit be held in a separate account, but landlords must handle deposits in compliance with the return requirements.

### The 14-Day Return Rule

Under 9 V.S.A. §4461, landlords must return the security deposit within **14 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the lease has terminated. This 14-day window applies to the return of the deposit or the delivery of an itemized statement of deductions.

The 14-day period begins when:

*   The tenant has vacated the premises
*   The lease term has ended or been properly terminated
*   The landlord has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with a **written itemized statement** detailing each deduction and the amount withheld for each item within the 14-day period.

### Permitted Deductions

Vermont landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Breach of lease terms** — Costs resulting from lease violations
4.  **Cleaning costs** — If the unit was not left in a reasonably clean condition
5.  **Unpaid utilities** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, and fading paint — cannot be deducted. Document the condition of the unit thoroughly at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 14 days, the tenant may be entitled to recover the full deposit amount. Under 9 V.S.A. §4461, the landlord may forfeit the right to make any deductions. In cases of bad faith or willful noncompliance, the tenant may recover damages and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Vermont

Vermont law provides strong protections for tenant habitability. Under 9 V.S.A. §4457, landlords are required to maintain rental premises in compliance with the implied warranty of habitability.

### Landlord Obligations Under §4457

Vermont landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, fire, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, and sanitary systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide adequate heating facilities capable of maintaining a reasonable temperature
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Maintain the structural integrity of the building, including roofs, walls, and foundations
*   Maintain smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors in working order

### Tenant's Maintenance Responsibilities

Under Vermont law, tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, damage, or remove any part of the premises
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving notice, tenants have several remedies:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is always to notify the landlord in writing. Under §4458, the tenant must give the landlord written notice specifying the deficient conditions. The landlord generally has **30 days** to remedy the condition for non-emergency situations.

#### 2. Rent Escrow

Under 9 V.S.A. §4458, if the landlord fails to make necessary repairs after proper notice, the tenant may petition the court to place rent in escrow until the landlord makes the repairs.

#### 3. Repair and Deduct

Vermont tenants may, in certain circumstances, arrange for necessary repairs and deduct the reasonable cost from rent after proper notice and the landlord's failure to act.

#### 4. Termination of Lease

If the landlord fails to address a material health or safety violation within a reasonable timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement with written notice under §4458.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit against the landlord for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can Vermont Landlords Enter?

Vermont law addresses landlord entry in 9 V.S.A. §4460, balancing the landlord's property rights with the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment.

### 48-Hour Notice Requirement

Under §4460, landlords must provide at least **48 hours' notice** before entering a rental unit. This is one of the longer notice periods in the country. The notice should specify the date, approximate time, and purpose of entry.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Performing routine maintenance
*   Other purposes agreed upon by both parties

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, gas leaks, burst pipes, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property. Landlords may also enter if they reasonably believe the tenant has abandoned the premises.

## Eviction Process in Vermont

Vermont's eviction procedures are governed by 9 V.S.A. §§4467–4468 and Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure. Landlords must follow these procedures precisely; failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Vermont landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Breaches of significant lease terms
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
5.  **Health or safety violations** — Tenant actions that endanger the property or other tenants
6.  **Sale of the property** — Under certain conditions after the property is sold

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: A **14-day notice** to pay or vacate under §4467(a)
*   **Material lease violation**: **30-day notice** to cure or vacate under §4467(b)
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **60 days' written notice** (for tenancies of two years or less) or **90 days' written notice** (for tenancies of more than two years) under §4467(c)
*   **Criminal activity or substantial threat**: **14-day notice** to vacate

### The Eviction Court Process

If the tenant does not comply with the notice, the landlord can file an eviction action in the Superior Court:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a complaint for ejectment with the Superior Court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 20–30 days
4.  **Judgment**: The judge hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
5.  **Writ of Possession**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of possession, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

Vermont law strictly prohibits self-help evictions. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant

Under §4463, violations can result in liability for actual damages, punitive damages, and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Retaliation Protections

Under 9 V.S.A. §4465, Vermont expressly prohibits landlord retaliation. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in response to a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right under the residential rental agreements law
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association
*   Testifying in a proceeding related to the rental

If a landlord takes adverse action within **90 days** of a tenant exercising a protected right, there is a rebuttable presumption of retaliation under Vermont law.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Vermont

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, the required notice period depends on the length of the tenancy:

*   **Tenancies of two years or less**: **60 days' written notice** under §4467(c)
*   **Tenancies of more than two years**: **90 days' written notice** under §4467(c)

Vermont's long notice periods for terminating month-to-month tenancies provide significant tenant protection.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or habitability obligations
*   Domestic violence situations (under 9 V.S.A. §4474a)
*   Uninhabitable conditions that the landlord refuses to remedy
*   Tenant is age 62 or older and is entering a residential care facility

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Vermont landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
