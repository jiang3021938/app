# Georgia Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Georgia Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/georgia-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Managing rental properties in Georgia requires a solid understanding of the state's landlord-tenant laws. While Georgia is often considered a landlord-friendly state compared to others, there are still critical regulations that property owners and managers must follow to stay compliant and avoid costly legal disputes. Whether you're a seasoned landlord or just starting out with your first rental property, understanding Georgia's legal framework is essential for success.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the most important aspects of Georgia landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. We'll reference the relevant Georgia Code statutes and provide practical insights to help you navigate common challenges. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities as a Georgia landlord.

Georgia's landlord-tenant relationship is primarily governed by Georgia Code §44-7-1 through §44-7-81, which covers everything from lease agreements to eviction procedures. While the state provides a framework, many provisions can be modified by mutual agreement in the lease, making it crucial to have well-drafted rental agreements.

## Understanding Georgia's Security Deposit Laws

Security deposits are one of the most common sources of disputes between landlords and tenants. Understanding Georgia's regulations can help you avoid these conflicts and maintain positive relationships with your renters.

### No Statutory Limit on Deposit Amounts

Unlike many states, **Georgia does not impose a statutory limit on security deposit amounts**. This gives landlords considerable flexibility in setting deposit amounts based on factors like property value, tenant qualifications, or local market conditions. However, charging an unreasonably high deposit could make your property less competitive in the rental market or potentially face scrutiny if challenged as unreasonable.

Most Georgia landlords typically charge between one to two months' rent as a security deposit, which aligns with industry standards and tenant expectations. If you choose to charge more, ensure it's justified and clearly explained in your lease agreement.

### The 30-Day Return Rule

Under Georgia Code §44-7-34, landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the property. This deadline applies whether or not the tenant provides a forwarding address, though providing one certainly makes the process smoother.

The 30-day period begins when the tenant:
- Surrenders the keys to the landlord
- Removes all personal belongings from the property
- Completely vacates the premises

If you need to make deductions from the deposit, you must provide an **itemized list** detailing each deduction along with the remaining balance (if any). Failure to comply with this requirement can result in the loss of your right to withhold any portion of the deposit and potential liability for the full amount plus court costs and attorney's fees if the tenant prevails in court.

### Permitted Deductions from Security Deposits

Georgia law allows landlords to make deductions from security deposits for:

1. **Unpaid rent** - Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2. **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** - Repairs for tenant-caused damage to the property
3. **Unpaid utilities** - If the lease makes the tenant responsible and they leave unpaid bills
4. **Breach of lease terms** - Costs resulting from lease violations
5. **Cleaning costs** - To restore the property to the condition it was in at move-in (excluding normal wear and tear)

**Normal wear and tear** includes minor scuffs, small nail holes from hanging pictures, fading paint, worn carpet in high-traffic areas, and other deterioration from ordinary use over time. You cannot deduct for these items.

To protect yourself, conduct thorough move-in and move-out inspections, document the property's condition with dated photos, and have the tenant sign the inspection checklist. This documentation is invaluable if a dispute arises.

### Best Practices for Handling Security Deposits

To stay compliant and minimize disputes:

- **Document everything**: Take detailed photos or videos during move-in and move-out inspections
- **Provide written receipts**: Give tenants a receipt for the security deposit when collected
- **Keep deposits separate**: While not legally required in Georgia, consider keeping security deposits in a separate account
- **Be timely**: Return deposits or provide itemized statements within the 30-day deadline
- **Be reasonable**: Only deduct for actual damages beyond normal wear and tear
- **Keep records**: Maintain copies of all documentation, receipts, and correspondence

## Eviction Process in Georgia: Steps and Requirements

Georgia's eviction process is governed by Georgia Code §44-7-50 through §44-7-52, and it's designed to be relatively efficient compared to many other states. However, landlords must follow the proper legal procedures or risk having their eviction dismissed.

### Grounds for Eviction

Georgia landlords can evict tenants for several reasons:

1. **Non-payment of rent** - The most common reason for eviction
2. **Lease violations** - Breaches of lease terms (unauthorized pets, subletting, etc.)
3. **Holding over** - Remaining after the lease term expires without renewing
4. **Criminal activity** - Engaging in illegal activities on the premises
5. **Material falsification** - Providing false information on the rental application

### Notice Requirements

Before filing for eviction, landlords must provide proper notice:

**For Non-Payment of Rent:**
There is no statutory requirement to provide notice before filing for eviction for non-payment of rent in Georgia. However, many leases include a grace period (typically 3-5 days), and providing a pay-or-quit notice is considered a best practice. Even without a statutory requirement, you should check your lease terms and consider giving at least a 3-day notice as a courtesy and to demonstrate good faith.

**For Lease Violations:**
For violations other than non-payment of rent, Georgia law does not require specific notice periods, but your lease agreement should specify the notice period required. Typically, landlords provide **7-30 days notice** depending on the severity of the violation and lease terms.

**For Holdover Tenants:**
If a tenant remains after the lease expires, you can file for eviction immediately, though a 30-day notice to terminate is common practice for month-to-month tenancies.

### The Eviction Court Process

Once proper notice has been given (if required), the eviction process follows these steps:

1. **File a Dispossessory Affidavit**: File with the magistrate or state court in the county where the property is located. Pay the filing fee (typically $75-$110).

2. **Tenant is Served**: The court will serve the tenant with a summons, typically giving them 7 days to respond.

3. **Tenant's Response**: The tenant can:
   - Pay the rent owed plus court costs (for non-payment cases)
   - File an answer disputing the eviction
   - Do nothing (default judgment)

4. **Court Hearing**: If the tenant files an answer, a hearing will be scheduled, typically within 10-30 days.

5. **Judgment**: If the landlord wins, the court issues a writ of possession.

6. **Writ of Possession**: This gives the tenant 7 days to vacate. After this period, the sheriff can physically remove the tenant.

The entire process typically takes 3-6 weeks from filing to physical removal, making Georgia one of the faster states for evictions.

### What Landlords Cannot Do

Georgia law prohibits "self-help" evictions. You cannot:
- Change the locks without a court order
- Shut off utilities to force a tenant out
- Remove the tenant's belongings
- Physically intimidate or harass tenants
- Enter the property without proper notice (except in emergencies)

Violating these rules can result in liability for damages, court costs, and attorney's fees if the tenant sues.

## Repair and Maintenance Obligations

Both landlords and tenants have specific responsibilities when it comes to property maintenance in Georgia.

### Landlord's Repair Obligations

Under Georgia Code §44-7-13, landlords must maintain the property in compliance with applicable housing codes and keep it in a **habitable condition**. This warranty of habitability requires landlords to:

- Maintain structural components (roof, walls, floors, foundation)
- Ensure plumbing and heating systems work properly
- Provide hot and cold running water
- Maintain electrical systems safely
- Keep common areas clean and safe
- Comply with building and housing codes
- Provide working smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors
- Control pest infestations (unless caused by tenant)
- Make repairs within a reasonable time after receiving notice

### Tenant's Responsibilities

Georgia Code §44-7-7 outlines tenant duties:

- Keep the premises clean and sanitary
- Use appliances and fixtures properly
- Dispose of trash appropriately
- Avoid damaging the property
- Comply with building and housing codes
- Report maintenance issues promptly
- Not disturb neighbors' peaceful enjoyment
- Allow landlord access for repairs with reasonable notice

### Repair Request Procedures

When a tenant requests repairs:

1. **Tenant's Request**: The tenant should provide written notice of the issue
2. **Landlord's Response**: You should acknowledge the request and provide a timeline
3. **Make Repairs**: Complete repairs within a reasonable time (generally 7-30 days depending on urgency)
4. **Emergency Repairs**: Handle immediately (broken pipes, no heat in winter, etc.)

If you fail to make necessary repairs, the tenant may have several remedies:
- Repair and deduct from rent (limited to one month's rent)
- Withhold rent (risky for tenants and must follow specific procedures)
- Terminate the lease
- Sue for damages

### Entry and Access Rights

While Georgia doesn't specify notice requirements for landlord entry, your lease should address this. Best practice is to provide **24-48 hours notice** except in emergencies. Acceptable reasons for entry include:
- Making repairs or inspections
- Showing the property to prospective tenants or buyers
- Emergencies (fire, flood, gas leak)
- Court order

Always respect tenant privacy and provide adequate notice unless there's a genuine emergency.

## Lease Termination and Renewal

Understanding how to properly terminate a lease in Georgia helps avoid disputes and legal complications.

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease (e.g., one-year lease) automatically expires at the end of the term. Neither party is required to provide notice of non-renewal, though it's good practice to communicate plans 30-60 days before expiration.

If the tenant holds over (stays beyond the lease end) and you continue accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement under the same terms.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, Georgia Code §44-7-7 requires **60 days written notice** to terminate the tenancy or modify lease terms (including rent increases). Both landlords and tenants must provide this notice.

The notice period begins on the date the notice is delivered, not when it's prepared or sent.

### Early Lease Termination

If a tenant wants to break a fixed-term lease early:

1. **Review the lease**: Check for early termination clauses
2. **Landlord's duty to mitigate**: Georgia law requires landlords to make reasonable efforts to re-rent the property
3. **Tenant liability**: The tenant remains liable for rent until you find a new tenant or the lease ends
4. **Security deposit**: Can be applied to unpaid rent and re-renting costs

Some situations allow tenants to break leases without penalty:
- Active military duty (Servicemembers Civil Relief Act)
- Landlord's failure to maintain habitability
- Domestic violence situations
- Landlord's material breach of lease

### Rent Increases

Georgia has no rent control laws, so you can increase rent by any amount. However, you must provide **60 days written notice** for month-to-month tenancies. For fixed-term leases, you cannot increase rent during the lease term unless the lease specifically allows it.

Best practices for rent increases:
- Research local market rates to stay competitive
- Provide clear written notice with the new amount and effective date
- Be reasonable—large increases may cause good tenants to leave
- Consider tenant's payment history and property condition

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I charge a non-refundable deposit in Georgia?**
A: Yes, Georgia law allows non-refundable fees if clearly labeled as such in the lease. However, these are different from security deposits, which must be refundable (minus legitimate deductions). Clearly distinguish between refundable security deposits and non-refundable fees like cleaning fees or pet fees.

**Q: What if a tenant abandons the property mid-lease?**
A: If a tenant abandons the property, you have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent. You can use the security deposit for unpaid rent and re-renting costs, but you must account for these deductions. Consider filing for a legal eviction even for abandoned properties to obtain a judgment for unpaid rent.

**Q: Do I need to provide receipts for security deposit deductions?**
A: While Georgia law doesn't explicitly require receipts, providing them is a best practice that demonstrates the legitimacy of your deductions. Courts will expect documentation if a dispute arises. Provide copies of invoices, receipts, or detailed estimates for work performed.

**Q: Can I enter the property whenever I want?**
A: No. While Georgia doesn't specify required notice periods, you should provide reasonable notice (typically 24-48 hours) except in emergencies. Your lease should specify entry procedures. Respecting tenant privacy maintains good relationships and avoids potential harassment claims.

**Q: What happens if I fail to return a security deposit on time?**
A: If you fail to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 30 days, you may forfeit your right to make any deductions. The tenant can sue to recover the full deposit, plus court costs and attorney's fees if they prevail.

**Q: Are there any exceptions to the eviction process?**
A: The standard eviction process must be followed in almost all cases. However, for particularly dangerous or criminal activity, landlords may be able to expedite the process. Consult with an attorney for specific situations, especially those involving safety concerns.
