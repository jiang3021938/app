# How to Review a Lease Agreement in 5 Minutes Using AI

## The Problem with Manual Review

A typical residential lease is 15-30 pages of dense legal language. Even experienced landlords spend 1-2 hours per lease review, and still miss critical issues. Multiply that by a portfolio of properties, and lease management becomes a significant time sink.

## Step 1: Upload Your Document

Simply upload your lease as a PDF or Word document. AI models can now parse complex legal documents with high accuracy, extracting key terms, dates, and financial details automatically.

## Step 2: Instant AI Extraction

Within seconds, AI identifies and extracts: tenant and landlord names, property address, rent amount and payment terms, security deposit details, lease dates, pet policies, late fee terms, and renewal conditions.

## Step 3: Risk Analysis

The AI doesn't just extract — it analyzes. It checks for missing standard clauses (like lead paint disclosures), identifies unusual or potentially unfair terms, and compares your lease against state-specific regulations.

## Step 4: Get Actionable Insights

The final report gives you a compliance score, risk flags with severity ratings, and specific recommendations for amendments. You can even generate a professional Amendment Suggestions Memo to share with your attorney or the other party.

## What About Accuracy?

Modern AI achieves high accuracy on standard lease agreements. However, we always recommend reviewing the AI output and consulting a legal professional for high-stakes decisions. Think of AI as your first pass — it catches the obvious issues instantly so you can focus your time on the nuanced ones.
