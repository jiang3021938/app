# Minnesota Security Deposit Law: Limits, Interest & Return Rules in 2026

![Minnesota Security Deposit Law Guide 2026](/assets/minnesota-security-deposit-law-hero.webp)

Security deposits are a critical component of rental agreements, providing financial protection for landlords while safeguarding tenant rights. In Minnesota, **Minnesota security deposit law** under Minnesota Statutes §504B.178 establishes comprehensive requirements that landlords must follow when collecting, holding, and returning security deposits.

Whether you're a landlord managing properties in Minneapolis, St. Paul, or elsewhere in Minnesota, or a tenant renting your first apartment, understanding these requirements is essential. Minnesota's security deposit laws include unique provisions such as mandatory interest payments, pre-move-out inspection rights, and strict penalties for non-compliance.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about Minnesota security deposit law in 2026, including deposit limits, return timelines, interest requirements, permitted deductions, and the consequences of violating these provisions. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and obligations under Minnesota law.

## Understanding Minnesota Statutes §504B.178: The Foundation of Security Deposit Law

Minnesota's primary security deposit statute, Minnesota Statutes §504B.178, governs how landlords must handle residential security deposits. This comprehensive law covers everything from maximum deposit amounts (or lack thereof) to return procedures and tenant remedies for violations.

The statute applies to most residential rental properties in Minnesota, including apartments, houses, condos, and townhomes. It applies statewide, though some cities like Minneapolis and St. Paul have additional local ordinances that provide extra tenant protections.

### What Qualifies as a Security Deposit?

Under Minnesota law, a security deposit includes any payment, fee, deposit, or prepayment given to the landlord to secure performance of the rental agreement or compensate for damages. This includes:

*   Traditional security deposits
*   Pet deposits
*   Damage deposits
*   Last month's rent (in some circumstances)

The key is the purpose of the payment. If it's meant to protect the landlord against default or damages, it's likely a security deposit subject to §504B.178's requirements.

## Security Deposit Limits in Minnesota: No Statutory Maximum

Unlike many states, Minnesota has **no statutory limit** on the amount landlords can charge for security deposits. This means a landlord could theoretically charge two, three, or even more months' rent as a security deposit.

However, just because there's no legal maximum doesn't mean landlords have unlimited discretion. Courts could potentially find an excessive security deposit unconscionable or evidence of bad faith, especially if it's clearly unrelated to the actual risk of property damage or unpaid rent.

### Practical Considerations for Landlords

Most Minnesota landlords charge between one and two months' rent for security deposits. Charging significantly more than market standards could:

*   Reduce your pool of qualified applicants
*   Create ill will with tenants from the start
*   Potentially expose you to legal challenges
*   Complicate the interest calculation requirements (discussed below)

When determining your security deposit amount, consider factors like property value, tenant screening results, pet policies, and local market norms.

### Local Ordinance Considerations

While Minnesota state law doesn't cap security deposits, some local ordinances may. For example, Minneapolis has various rental regulations that affect security deposits. Always check your city's ordinances to ensure full compliance.

## The 21-Day Return Rule: Timeline and Requirements

One of the most important aspects of **Minnesota security deposit law** is the return timeline. Under §504B.178, landlords must return security deposits or provide an itemized statement of withholdings within specific timeframes:

### Standard Return Timeline: 21 Days

If the landlord is **not** withholding any portion of the security deposit, they must return the full deposit within **21 days** after the tenant has vacated the premises and the landlord has received the tenant's forwarding address.

### Extended Timeline for Withholding: 26 Days

If the landlord **is** withholding any portion of the security deposit for damages or unpaid rent, they have up to **26 days** after the tenant vacates to provide:

*   An itemized list of damages or charges
*   The amount being withheld for each item
*   Any remaining balance of the deposit

This extended timeline acknowledges that landlords need time to assess damages, obtain repair estimates or receipts, and prepare proper documentation.

### When Does the Clock Start?

The timeline begins when:

1.  The tenant has vacated the premises (moved out completely), AND
2.  The landlord has received the tenant's forwarding address

If the tenant doesn't provide a forwarding address, the landlord should send the deposit or itemized statement to the rental property address. Keep proof of mailing in case of disputes.

### Consequences of Missing the Deadline

If a landlord fails to comply with the 21 or 26-day requirement, the tenant may sue to recover the deposit. If the court finds the landlord retained the deposit in bad faith, the landlord may be liable for:

*   The full deposit amount
*   Punitive damages up to $500
*   Reasonable attorney fees

This makes strict compliance with the return timeline critical for Minnesota landlords.

## Interest Requirements: A Unique Minnesota Provision

One of the most distinctive features of **Minnesota security deposit law** is the requirement that landlords pay interest on security deposits. Under §504B.178, landlords must pay **simple interest** at a rate of 1% per year on security deposits.

### When Interest Must Be Paid

Interest accrues from the time the deposit is received until it's returned to the tenant. The interest must be calculated annually and paid to the tenant at least once per year, either:

*   As a direct payment to the tenant, or
*   As a credit against rent

At the end of the tenancy, any accrued unpaid interest must be included with the returned security deposit.

### Calculating Security Deposit Interest

The calculation is straightforward: (Deposit Amount) × 0.01 × (Number of Years). For partial years, prorate the calculation.

**Example:**
*   Security deposit: $1,200
*   Length of tenancy: 2.5 years
*   Interest owed: $1,200 × 0.01 × 2.5 = $30

This might not seem like much, but failure to pay interest can result in the landlord being unable to withhold any portion of the deposit for damages. Many Minnesota landlords simply credit the annual interest against the following year's rent to simplify record-keeping.

### Exception for Small Deposits

If the security deposit is $50 or less, landlords are not required to pay interest. However, this exception is rarely relevant given typical deposit amounts.

## Permitted Deductions: What Can Landlords Withhold?

Minnesota law allows landlords to deduct from security deposits only for specific purposes. Understanding what constitutes a legitimate deduction—and what doesn't—is crucial for both landlords and tenants.

### Lawful Reasons for Withholding

Landlords can deduct from security deposits for:

*   **Unpaid rent**: Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
*   **Unpaid utilities**: If the tenant was responsible for utilities and left them unpaid
*   **Damages beyond normal wear and tear**: Repairs necessary to restore the unit to its condition at move-in, excluding ordinary deterioration
*   **Cleaning costs**: Only if the unit wasn't left as clean as it was at move-in (accounting for normal wear)
*   **Other lease violations**: Costs resulting from other breaches of the lease agreement

### Normal Wear and Tear: The Critical Distinction

Minnesota law, like most states, prohibits landlords from charging tenants for normal wear and tear. But what does that mean?

**Normal wear and tear** includes:

*   Minor scuffs or small marks on walls
*   Worn carpet in high-traffic areas
*   Faded paint or curtains due to sunlight
*   Small nail holes from picture hanging
*   Loose cabinet hinges from regular use
*   Minor scratches on hardwood floors from normal walking

**Damage beyond normal wear** includes:

*   Large holes in walls
*   Carpet stains, burns, or tears
*   Broken windows or doors
*   Missing or broken fixtures
*   Excessive dirt requiring professional cleaning
*   Pet damage (if pets were unauthorized or damage is excessive)

The distinction often comes down to whether the issue resulted from normal use over time or from negligence, carelessness, or abuse.

### Documentation Is Essential

The best protection for both landlords and tenants is thorough documentation:

*   **Move-in inspection**: Complete a detailed checklist with photos before the tenant moves in
*   **Move-out inspection**: Document the property's condition when the tenant leaves
*   **Receipts and invoices**: Keep all receipts for repairs and cleaning

Courts will generally side with the party that has better documentation, making these records invaluable in disputes.

## The Itemized Statement Requirement

When withholding any portion of a security deposit, Minnesota landlords must provide tenants with a detailed itemized statement. This isn't optional—it's a legal requirement under §504B.178.

### What Must Be Included

The itemized statement must show:

*   Each specific deduction with a clear description
*   The dollar amount of each deduction
*   The nature of the damage or charge
*   The remaining balance being returned

For repairs performed by contractors, include copies of receipts or invoices. If the landlord or their employees performed the work, provide a reasonable estimate of the time spent and the hourly rate charged.

### Sample Itemized Statement Format

A compliant itemized statement might look like:

```
Original Security Deposit: $1,500.00
Interest Owed: $15.00
Total Deposit + Interest: $1,515.00

Deductions:
- Repair hole in bedroom wall (receipt attached): $175.00
- Clean carpet stains in living room: $85.00
- Replace broken window blind: $45.00
- Unpaid water bill (receipt attached): $62.00
Total Deductions: $367.00

Balance Due to Tenant: $1,148.00
```

Generic statements like "damages - $500" or "cleaning - $200" are insufficient and may result in the landlord forfeiting the right to withhold any portion of the deposit.

## Pre-Move-Out Inspection Rights in Minnesota

Minnesota law gives tenants the valuable right to request a pre-move-out inspection. This provision, found in §504B.178, allows tenants to identify and potentially fix issues before they result in security deposit deductions.

### How It Works

At least 5 days before vacating, tenants can request an inspection of the premises. The landlord must:

*   Schedule the inspection at a reasonable time
*   Conduct a walk-through with the tenant (or allow the tenant to be present)
*   Identify any issues that could result in security deposit deductions

This gives tenants the opportunity to make repairs or clean areas that might otherwise result in charges. For example, if the landlord points out carpet stains during the pre-move-out inspection, the tenant could hire a carpet cleaner before moving out.

### Benefits for Both Parties

Pre-move-out inspections benefit everyone:

*   **Tenants** can address issues proactively, potentially recovering more of their deposit
*   **Landlords** reduce surprises and disputes, and may get repairs done more cheaply if the tenant handles them
*   **Both** benefit from improved communication and reduced likelihood of legal disputes

Landlords should encourage tenants to exercise this right and maintain detailed documentation of the inspection.

## Penalties for Non-Compliance: What Happens When Landlords Violate the Law

Minnesota takes security deposit violations seriously, with significant penalties for landlords who don't follow the law.

### Forfeiture of the Right to Withhold

If a landlord fails to comply with the return timeline or itemized statement requirements, they may **forfeit the right to withhold any portion of the security deposit**, even if they had legitimate reasons for deductions. The tenant is entitled to the full return of their deposit plus interest.

### Bad Faith Retention Penalties

If the landlord retained the security deposit in bad faith (knowing they didn't have a legal right to withhold it), Minnesota law allows courts to award:

*   **Punitive damages** up to $500
*   **Reasonable attorney fees** and court costs
*   The full **deposit amount**

"Bad faith" typically means the landlord knowingly violated the law, such as intentionally refusing to return a deposit they knew they had no right to withhold, or fabricating damage claims.

### Small Claims Court Process

Most security deposit disputes in Minnesota are resolved in conciliation court (Minnesota's small claims court). The process is:

1.  **File a claim**: File within the statute of limitations (generally 2-6 years depending on the claim)
2.  **Serve the defendant**: Properly serve the landlord with notice of the lawsuit
3.  **Attend the hearing**: Both parties present evidence
4.  **Receive judgment**: The judge issues a decision, often immediately

Conciliation court is designed to be accessible without attorneys, though either party may hire one if desired.

## Special Considerations for Minneapolis and St. Paul

While Minnesota Statutes §504B.178 applies statewide, cities like Minneapolis and St. Paul have additional rental housing regulations that affect security deposits.

### Minneapolis Rental Housing Ordinances

Minneapolis has specific requirements for rental property registration, inspections, and security deposits. Landlords must:

*   Register rental properties with the city
*   Provide tenants with specific disclosures
*   Comply with local inspection requirements
*   Follow city-specific notice requirements

### St. Paul Regulations

St. Paul similarly has a rental licensing system and additional tenant protections. Check with the city for specific requirements that may affect how you handle security deposits.

### Local Variations

Other Minnesota cities may have their own rental ordinances. Always check local regulations in addition to state law to ensure full compliance.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Minnesota Security Deposit Law

### Q1: Does my Minnesota landlord have to pay interest on my security deposit?

A1: Yes. Minnesota law requires landlords to pay simple interest at 1% per year on security deposits. The interest must be paid annually, either as a direct payment or credit against rent, and any remaining interest must be returned with the deposit when you move out.

### Q2: What happens if my landlord doesn't return my deposit within 21 days?

A2: If your landlord doesn't return your deposit or provide an itemized statement within the required timeframe (21 days if no deductions, 26 days if withholding), they may forfeit the right to withhold any portion of the deposit. You can sue in conciliation court to recover your deposit, plus potentially up to $500 in punitive damages and attorney fees if the retention was in bad faith.

### Q3: Can my landlord charge me for carpet replacement after I've lived there for 5 years?

A3: It depends on the carpet's condition. Normal wear and tear over 5 years cannot be charged to the tenant. Carpets have a useful life, and normal wearing from years of use is expected. However, if you caused specific damage (stains, burns, tears) beyond normal wear, the landlord can charge for repairs or replacement, possibly prorated based on the carpet's remaining useful life.

### Q4: What is a pre-move-out inspection and should I request one?

A4: A pre-move-out inspection is a walk-through with your landlord at least 5 days before you move out, during which the landlord identifies any issues that could result in security deposit deductions. Yes, you should absolutely request one! It gives you the opportunity to fix problems before they cost you money from your deposit.

### Q5: Can my landlord keep my deposit for normal cleaning?

A5: Only if the unit isn't left as clean as it was when you moved in (accounting for normal wear). Landlords cannot charge for cleaning that's part of normal turnover or maintaining the property. If you leave the unit in the same general cleanliness as move-in, the landlord cannot deduct cleaning costs.

## Conclusion: Mastering Minnesota Security Deposit Law for Success

Understanding **Minnesota security deposit law** is essential for maintaining positive, legally compliant landlord-tenant relationships. Minnesota Statutes §504B.178 provides clear requirements for deposit handling, return timelines, interest payments, and permitted deductions—but only if you know and follow them.

For tenants, knowing your rights empowers you to recover your full deposit and interest when you've fulfilled your lease obligations. For landlords, compliance protects you from forfeiting deposits and facing penalties while maintaining professional relationships with tenants.

The unique aspects of Minnesota law—particularly the interest requirement and pre-move-out inspection rights—set it apart from many other states. Staying compliant requires attention to detail, good record-keeping, and timely action.
