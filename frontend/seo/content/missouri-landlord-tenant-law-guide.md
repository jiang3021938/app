# Missouri Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Missouri Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/missouri-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Understanding **Missouri landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Show-Me State. Whether you own rental units in Kansas City, manage properties in St. Louis, or are a tenant in Springfield, knowing the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Missouri's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by **Missouri Revised Statutes Chapter 441** (Landlord-Tenant) and **Chapter 535** (Unlawful Detainer). Together, these statutes establish the core rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants throughout the state. Missouri also has specific security deposit provisions under **§535.300**.

This guide covers the most important aspects of Missouri landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. Whether you're a tenant seeking to understand your rights or a landlord working to maintain compliance, this article is your essential resource.

## Overview of Missouri's Landlord-Tenant Statutes

Missouri's landlord-tenant law is found primarily in Missouri Revised Statutes Chapters 441 and 535. Unlike some states, Missouri does not have a single unified residential landlord-tenant act modeled on the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. Instead, the rights and duties of landlords and tenants are drawn from a combination of statutory provisions and common law principles.

### Key Principles

Missouri landlord-tenant law establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and habitable
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith throughout the tenancy
*   Lease agreements form the primary basis for the landlord-tenant relationship
*   Self-help evictions are prohibited — landlords must use the court process

## Missouri Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Missouri's security deposit rules are outlined in Missouri Revised Statutes §535.300.

### Security Deposit Limit: 2 Months' Rent Maximum

Under Missouri Revised Statutes §535.300, Missouri landlords may charge a security deposit of up to **two months' rent**. This is a hard cap that applies statewide.

For example, if the monthly rent is $1,200, the maximum security deposit is $2,400. This limit includes all refundable deposits collected at the start of the tenancy, regardless of how they are labeled (e.g., "pet deposit," "cleaning deposit").

### The 30-Day Return Rule

Under §535.300, landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the rental agreement terminates. If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with a written **itemized list of deductions** within the same 30-day period.

The 30-day period begins when:

*   The tenant surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   All keys are returned to the landlord
*   The rental agreement has terminated

The landlord must mail the deposit and statement to the tenant's last known address or forwarding address.

### Permitted Deductions

Missouri landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Cleaning costs** — To restore the unit to the condition at move-in, beyond normal wear and tear
4.  **Other lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches

Normal wear and tear — such as minor wall scuffs, small nail holes, gently worn carpet, and faded paint — cannot be deducted. Thorough documentation at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists is essential.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 30 days, the tenant may pursue legal action. Under §535.300, a landlord who wrongfully withholds a deposit may be liable for up to **twice the amount wrongfully withheld**, plus court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Missouri

One of the most fundamental tenant protections under Missouri law is the implied warranty of habitability. While Missouri's habitability standards are based largely on common law rather than a single statutory provision, they are well-established in case law and reinforced by local housing codes.

### Landlord Obligations

Missouri landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, and other systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Provide adequate heat during winter months
*   Maintain structural components of the building (roof, walls, floors, foundations)
*   Maintain appliances supplied or required by the lease agreement

### Tenant Maintenance Responsibilities

Missouri tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, or damage the property
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Allow the landlord reasonable access for repairs and inspections

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving written notice, tenants have several remedies under Missouri law:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

Tenants must first provide written notice to the landlord describing the condition that requires repair. The landlord should be given a reasonable period to make repairs, typically **14 days** for non-emergency issues.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

Under Missouri common law and local ordinances in some municipalities, tenants may arrange for repairs and deduct the reasonable cost from rent if the landlord fails to act within a reasonable time after proper notice.

#### 3. Rent Withholding

If the landlord's failure to maintain habitability materially affects health and safety, the tenant may withhold rent until the repairs are completed. Tenants should document all communications and conditions thoroughly.

#### 4. Lease Termination

If the landlord fails to remedy a material health or safety violation within a reasonable timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement with proper written notice.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can Missouri Landlords Enter?

Missouri law does not have a single statewide statute specifying exact notice requirements for landlord entry. However, the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment is well-established under common law and lease provisions.

### Reasonable Notice Requirement

Missouri landlords are expected to provide **reasonable notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. While there is no specific statutory requirement, **24 hours** is widely accepted as the standard for reasonable notice. Entry must occur at reasonable times.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services
*   Other purposes permitted by the lease agreement

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as:

*   Fire or imminent danger to persons or property
*   Burst pipes, gas leaks, or other urgent maintenance issues
*   Reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the premises

If a landlord repeatedly enters without proper notice, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief and may recover damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

## Eviction Process in Missouri

Missouri's eviction procedures are governed by Missouri Revised Statutes Chapter 441 and Chapter 535 (Unlawful Detainer). Landlords must follow these procedures precisely — failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Missouri landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Significant breaches of the lease agreement
3.  **Substantial damage to the property** — Willful or negligent destruction
4.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises, particularly drug-related offenses
5.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires without renewal
6.  **Violation of health or safety codes** — Conditions that endanger other tenants or the property

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper written notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: Missouri does not require a specific statutory notice period before filing for rent-based eviction; however, landlords customarily provide a **demand for rent** or follow lease terms
*   **Lease violation**: Notice as specified in the lease agreement, typically **10 to 30 days** depending on the violation
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **One month's written notice** (Missouri Revised Statutes §441.060)
*   **Holdover tenancy**: Landlord may proceed with unlawful detainer after lease expiration

### The Eviction Court Process (Unlawful Detainer / Rent and Possession)

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the landlord can file an unlawful detainer or rent and possession action:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a petition with the circuit court or associate circuit court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and petition
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within a few days to four weeks
4.  **Trial**: Both parties present evidence
5.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Execution/Restitution**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Prohibited

Missouri law strictly prohibits self-help evictions. Landlords cannot:

*   Change or remove locks
*   Shut off utilities (heat, water, electricity, gas)
*   Remove doors or windows
*   Remove tenant belongings without a court order

Violations can result in liability for actual damages plus reasonable attorney's fees and, in some jurisdictions, statutory penalties.

## Retaliation Protections

Missouri recognizes protections against retaliatory conduct by landlords. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in retaliation for a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any legal right
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

While Missouri does not have a specific anti-retaliation statute, retaliatory eviction has been recognized as an affirmative defense in Missouri courts. Tenants who can demonstrate a causal connection between their protected activity and the landlord's adverse action may be able to defeat an eviction.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Missouri

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Neither party is required to give notice of non-renewal unless the lease specifies otherwise. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement on the same terms.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **one month's written notice** (one full rental period) before the end of a rental period under Missouri Revised Statutes §441.060.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or habitability obligations
*   Domestic violence situations (with proper documentation and notice under Missouri law)
*   Unit becomes uninhabitable due to casualty damage

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Missouri landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
