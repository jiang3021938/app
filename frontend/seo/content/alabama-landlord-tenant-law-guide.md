# Alabama Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Alabama Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/alabama-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Navigating **Alabama landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the state. Whether you own rental units in Birmingham, manage properties in Huntsville, or are a tenant in Mobile, understanding the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Alabama's primary residential landlord-tenant statute is the **Alabama Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (AURLTA)**, codified in Alabama Code Title 35, Chapter 9A (§§35-9A-101 through 35-9A-603). This act applies to most residential rental agreements and provides the baseline rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants throughout the state.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of Alabama landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities under Alabama law.

## Overview of the Alabama Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act

The AURLTA, found in Alabama Code Title 35, Chapter 9A, establishes a comprehensive framework for residential rental relationships. It applies to most residential rental agreements in the state, with limited exceptions for certain institutional housing and properties with fewer than two rental units where the owner personally manages the property.

### Key Principles

The Act establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and habitable
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith throughout the tenancy
*   Lease agreements cannot waive the protections provided by the Act
*   Retaliatory actions by landlords are prohibited

## Alabama Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Alabama's rules are outlined in Alabama Code §35-9A-201.

### No Statutory Limit on Deposit Amount

Unlike many states, **Alabama does not impose a statutory limit on the amount a landlord can collect as a security deposit**. This gives landlords flexibility to set deposit amounts based on property value, risk assessment, and market conditions. However, charging an unreasonably high deposit may deter prospective tenants and could face scrutiny in court.

Most Alabama landlords charge between one and two months' rent as a security deposit, which aligns with industry norms and tenant expectations.

### The 60-Day Return Rule

Under Alabama Code §35-9A-201(b), landlords must return the security deposit within **60 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and provides a forwarding address. This is one of the longer return windows among U.S. states.

The 60-day period begins when the tenant:

*   Surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   Returns all keys to the landlord
*   Provides a written forwarding address

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with an **itemized statement** detailing each deduction along with the remaining balance.

### Permitted Deductions

Alabama landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Breach of lease terms** — Costs resulting from lease violations
4.  **Unpaid utilities** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, and fading paint — cannot be deducted. Document the condition of the unit thoroughly at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 60 days, the tenant may recover the full deposit amount. In cases of bad faith retention, the tenant may be entitled to damages up to twice the amount wrongfully withheld, plus reasonable attorney's fees under §35-9A-201(d).

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Alabama

One of the most fundamental tenant protections under the AURLTA is the right to a safe, habitable dwelling. Alabama Code §35-9A-204 outlines the landlord's maintenance obligations.

### Landlord Obligations Under §35-9A-204

Alabama landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems in good working order
*   Provide running water and hot water
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal where applicable
*   Maintain appliances supplied or required by the lease agreement

### Tenant's Maintenance Responsibilities

Under Alabama Code §35-9A-301, tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, and heating systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy property
*   Comply with building and housing codes
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving written notice, tenants have several remedies under the AURLTA:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is always to notify the landlord in writing. Under §35-9A-401, the landlord generally has **14 days** to remedy a non-emergency condition after receiving written notice. For conditions that pose an imminent threat to health or safety, the timeframe is shorter.

#### 2. Termination of Lease

If the landlord fails to address a material health or safety violation within the required timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement under §35-9A-401. The tenant must provide written notice of termination and vacate within 30 days.

#### 3. Repair and Deduct

In certain circumstances, tenants may arrange for repairs and deduct the cost from rent. However, this remedy has strict requirements and limitations. Always document the issue, the notice given, the landlord's failure to respond, and the cost of repairs.

#### 4. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit against the landlord for breach of the habitability warranty, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can Alabama Landlords Enter?

Alabama law balances the landlord's need to access the property with the tenant's right to privacy.

### Notice Requirements Under §35-9A-303

Under the AURLTA, landlords must provide **two days' (48 hours') notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Entry must occur at reasonable times.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Other purposes agreed upon by both parties

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, gas leaks, burst pipes, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property. Landlords may also enter if they reasonably believe the tenant has abandoned the premises.

## Eviction Process in Alabama

Alabama's eviction procedures are governed by Alabama Code §35-9A-421 through §35-9A-461. Landlords must follow these procedures precisely; failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Alabama landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Breaches of significant lease terms
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
5.  **Health or safety violations** — Tenant actions that endanger the property or other tenants

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **7-day notice** to pay or vacate (§35-9A-421)
*   **Material lease violation**: **14-day notice** to remedy or vacate (§35-9A-421)
*   **Immediate termination**: For serious violations involving criminal activity, assault, or drug-related offenses — **7-day unconditional notice** to vacate (§35-9A-421(a))
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** (§35-9A-441)

### The Eviction Court Process

If the tenant does not comply with the notice, the landlord can file an unlawful detainer action in district court:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files an unlawful detainer complaint with the district court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 7–14 days
4.  **Judgment**: The judge hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
5.  **Writ of Possession**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of possession, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

Alabama law strictly prohibits self-help evictions. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant

Violations can result in liability for actual damages, plus up to three months' periodic rent, and reasonable attorney's fees under §35-9A-407.

## Retaliation Protections

Alabama Code §35-9A-501 protects tenants from retaliatory actions by landlords. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in response to a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right granted by the AURLTA
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

If retaliatory action occurs within one year of a protected activity, the tenant may raise retaliation as a defense to eviction and may recover damages.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Alabama

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Neither party is required to give notice of non-renewal unless the lease specifies otherwise. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before termination under §35-9A-441.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or the AURLTA
*   Domestic violence situations (with proper documentation)
*   Uninhabitable conditions that the landlord refuses to remedy

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Alabama landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
