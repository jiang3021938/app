# Louisiana Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Louisiana Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/louisiana-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Understanding **Louisiana landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Pelican State. Whether you own rental units in New Orleans, manage properties in Baton Rouge, or are a tenant in Shreveport, knowing the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Louisiana's legal system is unique in the United States — rooted in the Napoleonic civil law tradition rather than English common law. Residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by the **Louisiana Civil Code Articles 2668 through 2729** (governing lease obligations) and **Louisiana Revised Statutes Title 9, §§9:3251 through 9:3261** (the Security Deposit Act). Unlike most other states, Louisiana does not have a comprehensive Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.

This guide covers the most important aspects of Louisiana landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. Whether you're a tenant seeking to understand your rights or a landlord working to maintain compliance, this article will serve as your essential resource.

## Overview of Louisiana Landlord-Tenant Law

Louisiana's landlord-tenant framework draws from two primary sources:

*   **Louisiana Civil Code Articles 2668–2729**: These articles define the lease contract ("bail"), establishing the fundamental obligations of lessors (landlords) and lessees (tenants), including the duty to deliver premises in good condition, maintain them during the lease, and ensure the tenant's peaceable possession.
*   **Louisiana Revised Statutes Title 9, §§9:3251–9:3261**: This is the Louisiana Security Deposit Act, which provides specific rules for handling residential security deposits.

### Key Principles

Louisiana's landlord-tenant law establishes several fundamental principles:

*   The landlord must deliver the premises in a condition suitable for the intended use (La. C.C. Art. 2682)
*   The landlord must maintain the premises in a condition suitable for the purpose for which it was leased (La. C.C. Art. 2691)
*   The tenant must use the premises as a prudent administrator and pay rent as agreed (La. C.C. Art. 2710)
*   Eviction must follow legal procedures through the courts
*   Security deposits must be handled according to the Security Deposit Act

## Louisiana Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Louisiana's security deposit rules are detailed in Louisiana Revised Statutes §9:3251 through §9:3261.

### No Statutory Limit on Deposit Amount

**Louisiana does not impose a statutory cap on the amount a landlord may collect as a security deposit.** This gives landlords flexibility to set deposit amounts based on property value, risk assessment, and market conditions. However, charging an unreasonably high deposit may deter prospective tenants and could be challenged in court.

Most Louisiana landlords charge between one and two months' rent as a security deposit, which aligns with industry standards and tenant expectations.

### The 30-Day Return Rule

Under Louisiana RS §9:3251, landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the lease terminates. If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with a written **itemized statement** of deductions within the same 30-day period.

The return period begins when:

*   The tenant surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   All keys are returned to the landlord
*   The lease has terminated

The landlord must mail the deposit and statement to the tenant's last known address or forwarding address.

### Permitted Deductions

Louisiana landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage to the premises
3.  **Cleaning costs** — To restore the unit to the condition at the beginning of the lease, beyond normal wear
4.  **Other amounts due under the lease** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches

Normal wear and tear — such as minor wall scuffs, small nail holes, gently worn carpet, and faded paint — cannot be deducted. Thorough documentation with dated photos at move-in and move-out is strongly recommended.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 30 days, the consequences can be significant. Under Louisiana RS §9:3252, a landlord who acts in **bad faith** by failing to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement may be liable for:

*   The full deposit amount
*   **Penalties of up to $200** or actual damages, whichever is greater
*   Reasonable attorney's fees

If the landlord willfully fails to comply after written demand, the penalties can increase. The tenant may also recover court costs.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Louisiana

Louisiana Civil Code Article 2682 establishes the landlord's fundamental obligation to deliver and maintain rental premises in a condition suitable for their intended use.

### Landlord Obligations Under the Civil Code

Under Louisiana Civil Code Articles 2682, 2691, and 2692, Louisiana landlords must:

*   Deliver the premises in a condition suitable for the purpose for which it was leased
*   Maintain the premises in a condition suitable for the intended use during the entire lease
*   Make all necessary repairs to maintain the premises in suitable condition
*   Ensure the tenant's peaceable possession throughout the lease term
*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes
*   Maintain structural elements (roof, walls, foundation, windows) in sound condition
*   Keep plumbing, electrical, heating, and cooling systems in working order

### Tenant Maintenance Responsibilities

Under Louisiana Civil Code Articles 2710 and 2715, tenants must:

*   Use the premises as a prudent administrator (reasonable person standard)
*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Make minor repairs that are necessary due to the tenant's use
*   Not deliberately or negligently damage the property
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord
*   Return the premises in the condition received, minus normal wear and tear

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in suitable condition, Louisiana tenants have several remedies:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is to notify the landlord in writing, clearly describing the condition that requires repair. Louisiana law expects tenants to give the landlord a reasonable opportunity to make repairs before pursuing other remedies.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

Under Louisiana Civil Code Article 2694, if the landlord fails to make necessary repairs after being put in default (formal notice), the tenant may cause the repairs to be made and **deduct the cost from rent**. This is a well-established remedy under Louisiana civil law, but it must be exercised with care and proper documentation.

#### 3. Rent Reduction

Under Louisiana Civil Code Article 2700, if the premises become partially unsuitable for their intended use due to the landlord's failure to maintain them, the tenant may obtain a **reduction in rent** proportional to the diminished value of the premises.

#### 4. Lease Dissolution

Under Louisiana Civil Code Article 2700, if the premises become totally unsuitable or the landlord's breach is substantial, the tenant may seek dissolution of the lease through the courts.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file suit for breach of the landlord's maintenance obligations, seeking damages, rent reduction, lease dissolution, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can Louisiana Landlords Enter?

Louisiana does not have a specific statute establishing a required notice period for landlord entry. However, the tenant's right to peaceable possession under the Civil Code and general legal principles establish protections.

### Notice and Entry Standards

While Louisiana lacks a specific statute mandating a set number of hours' notice, the following standards apply based on Civil Code principles and standard lease provisions:

*   **Reasonable notice** must be given before entry — **24 hours** is the generally accepted standard
*   Entry must occur at **reasonable times** during normal business hours
*   The landlord must have a **legitimate purpose** for entry

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services
*   Under court order

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without prior notice in genuine emergencies, such as:

*   Fire or imminent danger to persons or property
*   Burst pipes, gas leaks, or other urgent maintenance issues
*   Reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the premises

## Eviction Process in Louisiana

Louisiana's eviction procedures are governed by Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Articles 4701 through 4735 (eviction proceedings). Landlords must follow these procedures precisely — failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Louisiana landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Lease violations** — Significant breaches of the lease agreement
3.  **Expiration of lease term** — The lease has ended and tenant remains
4.  **Occupancy after notice to vacate** — Remaining after proper termination notice
5.  **Illegal use of premises** — Using the property for unlawful purposes

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper written notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **5-day notice** to pay or vacate (La. C.C.P. Art. 4701)
*   **Lease violation**: Notice period depends on the lease terms; typically the landlord must put the tenant in default and allow a reasonable time to cure
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **10 days' written notice** before the end of the rental period (La. C.C. Art. 2728)
*   **Expiration of fixed-term lease**: No notice required if the lease specifies the termination date, unless the lease requires it

### The Eviction Court Process

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the landlord can file an eviction proceeding:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a Rule for Eviction with the appropriate court (justice of the peace, city, or district court depending on jurisdiction)
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the rule to show cause
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within a few days to two weeks
4.  **Trial**: Both parties present evidence and arguments
5.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Possession**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of possession, and the sheriff or constable can physically remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Prohibited

Louisiana law strictly prohibits self-help evictions. Under Louisiana RS §9:3251.1 and general civil law principles, landlords cannot:

*   Change or remove locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities (water, gas, electricity, heat)
*   Remove tenant belongings without a court order
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant
*   Block access to the rental unit

A landlord who engages in self-help eviction may be liable for actual damages, penalties, and attorney's fees.

## Retaliation Protections

Louisiana does not have a specific anti-retaliation statute as comprehensive as some states. However, the following protections apply:

*   Landlords cannot evict tenants solely for exercising legal rights
*   Tenants who report health and safety violations to government agencies have some protection under general legal principles
*   Lease provisions that purport to waive a tenant's right to report violations may be unenforceable

Tenants who believe they are victims of retaliation should document all communications and consult with an attorney.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Louisiana

### Fixed-Term Leases

Under Louisiana Civil Code Article 2720, a fixed-term lease expires at the end of the stated term without the need for notice, unless the lease specifies otherwise. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord does not object, the lease is considered **reconducted** (renewed) on a month-to-month basis under the same terms.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **10 days' written notice** before the end of a rental period under Louisiana Civil Code Article 2728.

### Week-to-Week Tenancies

For week-to-week tenancies, either party must provide notice equivalent to the rental period.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's failure to maintain the premises in a suitable condition (La. C.C. Art. 2700)
*   Unit becomes totally unsuitable for its intended purpose due to destruction or force majeure
*   Certain domestic violence situations with proper documentation

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early may be liable for rent through the end of the lease term or until the landlord re-rents the unit. Louisiana law imposes a duty on the landlord to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is there a limit on how much a landlord can charge for a security deposit in Louisiana?

### Q: How long does my Louisiana landlord have to return my security deposit?

A: Under Louisiana RS §9:3251, landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates and the lease terminates. If deductions are made, a written itemized statement must be provided within the same timeframe.

### Q: Can my Louisiana landlord enter my apartment without notice?

A: Louisiana does not have a specific statute setting a required notice period. However, based on the tenant's right to peaceable possession under the Civil Code, **reasonable notice** (generally 24 hours) at reasonable times is the accepted standard. Emergency entry is permitted without notice.

Louisiana also uses unique terminology — landlords are "lessors," tenants are "lessees," and lease renewal is called "reconduction."
