# California Lease Agreement: 10 Clauses Every Landlord Must Include

## Why California Is Different

California has some of the most tenant-friendly laws in the nation. As a landlord, your lease must comply with the California Civil Code, local rent control ordinances, and recently enacted legislation like AB 1482 (the Tenant Protection Act). Missing a required disclosure or clause doesn't just create risk — it can void parts of your agreement entirely.

## 1. Security Deposit Terms (Civil Code §1950.5)

California previously capped security deposits at 2 months' rent for unfurnished units and 3 months' for furnished. As of July 2024, AB 12 reduced this to just 1 month's rent for most landlords, and this remains the current limit. Your lease must clearly state the deposit amount, the conditions for deductions, and the 21-day return timeline.

## 2. Rent Increase Notice Requirements

Under AB 1482, annual rent increases are capped at 5% + local CPI (max 10%) for properties 15+ years old. You must provide 30 days notice for increases under 10% and 90 days for 10% or more. Include specific language about how and when rent may be adjusted.

## 3. Lead-Based Paint Disclosure

For any property built before 1978, federal law requires a lead-based paint disclosure. Failure to provide this can result in penalties up to $19,507 per violation. Include the EPA pamphlet and disclosure form as lease addenda.

## 4. Entry Notice Requirements (Civil Code §1954)

Landlords must provide 24 hours written notice before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Your lease should specify the notice method and permitted reasons for entry.

## 5. Maintenance Responsibilities

California's implied warranty of habitability requires landlords to maintain livable conditions. Your lease should clearly delineate maintenance responsibilities between landlord and tenant, including who handles minor repairs, pest control, and appliance maintenance.

## 6. Late Fee Policy

California law requires that late fees be "reasonable" — typically no more than 5–6% of the monthly rent. Your lease must specify the grace period, the fee amount, and how it's calculated.

## 7. Pet Policy and Pet Deposits

If you allow pets, your lease should detail any pet deposit (included in the overall deposit cap under AB 12), breed or size restrictions, and tenant responsibilities for pet damage.

## 8. Subletting and Assignment Clause

California tenants generally have the right to sublet unless the lease explicitly prohibits it. Include clear language about subletting requirements and your approval process.

## 9. Mold and Bed Bug Disclosures

California Civil Code §1942.5 and local ordinances may require disclosures about mold and pest history. Include appropriate addenda covering these disclosures.

## 10. Termination and Renewal Terms

Specify how the lease terminates, what happens at the end of the term (auto-renewal vs. month-to-month conversion), and the notice requirements for non-renewal under AB 1482's just-cause eviction protections.
