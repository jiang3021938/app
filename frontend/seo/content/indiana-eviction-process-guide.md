# Indiana Eviction Process 2026: Steps, Notices & Tenant Rights

![Indiana Eviction Process Guide 2026](/assets/indiana-eviction-process-guide-hero.webp)

The **Indiana eviction process** can be complex and intimidating for both landlords and tenants. Understanding Indiana's specific requirements—from notice periods to court procedures—is essential for landlords who need to regain possession of their property and for tenants who want to protect their rights during what is often a stressful situation.

Indiana Code Title 32, particularly chapters dealing with landlord-tenant relationships, establishes the framework for evictions in the state. While Indiana's laws are generally considered more landlord-friendly than states like California or New York, landlords must still follow specific procedures, and tenants retain important rights throughout the process.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the Indiana eviction process in 2026, including notice requirements, court filing procedures, tenant defenses, security deposit rules under Indiana Code §32-31-3, and how to handle evictions legally and effectively. Whether you're a landlord in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Evansville, or anywhere else in Indiana, this article will serve as your essential resource.

## Understanding Indiana's Eviction Framework

Indiana's eviction laws are primarily found in Indiana Code Title 32, Article 31. These statutes govern landlord-tenant relationships, security deposits, property maintenance obligations, and eviction procedures. Unlike some states with extensive tenant protection laws, Indiana's approach tends to favor property owners' rights while still providing basic protections for tenants.

### When Can Landlords Evict in Indiana?

Indiana landlords can evict tenants for several legally recognized reasons:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: The most common reason for eviction
*   **Lease violations**: Material breaches of the lease agreement
*   **Illegal activity**: Criminal conduct on the premises
*   **Lease expiration**: When a fixed-term lease ends and the tenant holds over
*   **No cause (month-to-month)**: Terminating a month-to-month tenancy with proper notice

Each ground for eviction has specific notice requirements and procedures that must be followed precisely. Deviating from the proper process can result in your case being dismissed and having to start over.

## Notice Requirements: The Critical First Step

Before filing an eviction lawsuit in Indiana, landlords must provide tenants with proper written notice. The type and length of notice depend on the reason for eviction.

### Nonpayment of Rent: 10-Day Notice to Pay or Quit

For nonpayment of rent, Indiana law requires landlords to provide a **10-day notice**. This notice must:

*   Be in writing
*   Clearly state the amount of rent owed
*   Give the tenant 10 days to pay the rent or vacate
*   Be properly served on the tenant

The 10-day period begins the day after the notice is served. If the tenant pays the full amount owed within the 10 days, the landlord generally cannot proceed with eviction for that particular non-payment.

**Important**: The notice must demand payment of rent only, not other charges like late fees or utilities. Including other charges in the notice could make it invalid.

### Lease Violations: Notice to Comply or Quit

For lease violations other than nonpayment of rent, landlords should provide notice giving the tenant an opportunity to cure the violation. While Indiana law doesn't specify a statewide requirement for this type of notice, many leases include provisions for cure periods (often 10-30 days).

If the lease specifies a notice period for violations, you must follow it. If the lease doesn't specify, providing a reasonable notice period (typically 10-30 days depending on the severity of the violation) is advisable.

### Terminating Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies where the landlord wants to terminate without cause, Indiana law requires:

*   **One month's notice** to terminate the tenancy
*   The notice must be given before the beginning of the rental period

For example, if rent is due on the first of each month and you want the tenant out by December 1st, you must give notice by November 1st (or earlier). Notice given on November 15th would only be effective for January 1st.

### Fixed-Term Lease Expiration

When a fixed-term lease expires, the landlord is not required to provide additional notice to terminate the tenancy if the tenant holds over (stays past the lease end date). However, many landlords provide courtesy notice to clarify expectations.

### Proper Service of Notice

Indiana notices must be properly served. Acceptable methods typically include:

*   **Personal delivery**: Handing the notice directly to the tenant
*   **Posting**: Affixing the notice to the main entrance of the premises
*   **Certified mail**: Sending via certified mail, return receipt requested

Document how and when you served the notice, as you'll need to prove proper service if the tenant contests the eviction.

## Filing the Eviction Lawsuit: Court Procedures

If the tenant doesn't comply with the notice (doesn't pay rent, doesn't cure the violation, or doesn't vacate), the landlord can file an eviction lawsuit. In Indiana, evictions are handled through a process called "possessory action" or "holdover action."

### Where to File

Eviction cases are filed in the small claims court or circuit/superior court in the county where the rental property is located. Most landlords use small claims court because:

*   Filing fees are lower
*   Procedures are simpler
*   Hearings are usually scheduled faster
*   Attorneys aren't required (though you can hire one)

### Required Documents

To file an eviction, you'll typically need:

*   **Complaint for possession**: The formal document initiating the lawsuit
*   **Lease agreement**: Copy of the rental agreement
*   **Proof of notice**: Evidence you properly served the required notice
*   **Rent ledger**: Documentation of rent owed (for nonpayment cases)
*   **Filing fee**: Varies by county, typically $85-$100

### Service of Process

After filing, the court will issue a summons that must be served on the tenant along with the complaint. In Indiana, service is typically performed by:

*   Sheriff's deputy
*   Private process server
*   Certified mail (in some circumstances)

The tenant must receive notice of the court hearing date, time, and location. Improper service can result in your case being dismissed.

## The Eviction Hearing: What to Expect

After filing, the court will schedule a hearing, typically within 2-4 weeks. Both landlord and tenant can present evidence and testimony.

### Landlord's Burden of Proof

The landlord must prove:

*   A valid landlord-tenant relationship existed
*   Proper notice was given
*   The tenant failed to comply with the notice
*   The landlord is entitled to possession

Bring all relevant documentation:

*   Original lease agreement
*   Proof of proper notice
*   Rent payment records
*   Photos of property condition (if relevant)
*   Any correspondence with the tenant

### Tenant Defenses

Tenants can raise several defenses to eviction:

*   **Improper notice**: The landlord didn't provide proper notice or the notice was defective
*   **Rent was paid**: The tenant did pay rent (requires proof)
*   **Landlord's breach**: The landlord failed to maintain habitable conditions
*   **Retaliation**: The eviction is in retaliation for the tenant exercising legal rights
*   **Discrimination**: The eviction is based on protected class status

If the tenant raises a valid defense, the court may dismiss the eviction or delay it until issues are resolved.

### Court Decision

If the landlord wins, the court issues a **judgment for possession**, which is essentially an eviction order. The judgment will typically specify:

*   The date by which the tenant must vacate
*   Any money judgment for unpaid rent or damages
*   Court costs

If the tenant doesn't voluntarily leave by the specified date, the landlord can request a writ of possession.

## Writ of Possession and Physical Removal

A judgment for possession doesn't automatically remove the tenant. If the tenant doesn't leave voluntarily, the landlord must obtain a writ of possession from the court.

### Requesting the Writ

After the judgment, if the tenant hasn't vacated, the landlord can request a writ of possession (sometimes called a writ of restitution or writ of execution). There may be a brief waiting period before the writ can be issued.

### Sheriff's Execution

Once the writ is issued, it's delivered to the county sheriff, who will:

1.  Post a notice at the property giving the tenant a final deadline to leave (typically 24-48 hours)
2.  Return to physically remove the tenant if they haven't left
3.  Oversee the removal of the tenant's belongings if necessary

The sheriff's involvement is legally required—landlords cannot physically remove tenants themselves.

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

Indiana law prohibits self-help evictions. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks before obtaining a court order and writ of possession
*   Remove tenant belongings without following proper procedures
*   Shut off utilities to force the tenant out
*   Use threats, intimidation, or force

These actions can result in the landlord being sued for wrongful eviction, facing damages, and potentially criminal charges. Always use the legal process.

## Security Deposits and Evictions: Indiana Code §32-31-3-12

Even during evictions, Indiana's security deposit laws continue to apply. Understanding these requirements is crucial for both protecting your financial interests and avoiding legal violations.

### Security Deposit Limits

Indiana has **no statutory limit** on security deposit amounts. Landlords can charge whatever they deem appropriate, though excessive amounts could potentially be challenged as unconscionable. Most Indiana landlords charge one to two months' rent.

### The 45-Day Return Rule

Under Indiana Code §32-31-3-12, landlords must return security deposits or provide an itemized statement of deductions within **45 days** after the tenant vacates the premises.

This timeline applies even in eviction situations. If you evict a tenant, you still have 45 days from when they actually leave to return the deposit or provide the itemized statement.

### Permitted Deductions After Eviction

Landlords can deduct from security deposits for:

*   **Unpaid rent**: Including rent through the date of eviction
*   **Damages beyond normal wear and tear**: Repair costs for tenant-caused damage
*   **Cleaning costs**: If the unit wasn't left reasonably clean
*   **Lease violations**: Costs resulting from breaches of the lease
*   **Court costs**: If awarded by the court in the eviction judgment

Normal wear and tear cannot be charged to the tenant. This includes minor scuffs, worn carpet from ordinary use, or faded paint.

### Itemized Statement Requirements

When withholding any portion of the deposit, provide a detailed itemized statement showing:

*   Each specific deduction with description
*   The dollar amount of each deduction
*   Receipts or estimates for repairs
*   The remaining balance (if any)

Generic statements like "damages - $1,500" are insufficient and could result in the tenant successfully suing to recover the deposit.

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 45 days, the tenant can sue to recover the deposit. If the landlord acted in bad faith, the tenant may recover the deposit plus damages.

## Tenant Rights During the Eviction Process

Even when facing eviction, tenants in Indiana retain important rights that landlords must respect.

### Right to Proper Notice

Tenants have the right to receive proper written notice before an eviction lawsuit is filed. The notice must meet legal requirements for content and service.

### Right to a Court Hearing

Tenants have the right to present their case in court. The landlord cannot evict without a court order, except in cases where the tenant voluntarily agrees to leave.

### Right to Raise Defenses

Tenants can raise legal defenses to eviction, including:

*   Improper notice or procedure
*   Rent was actually paid
*   Landlord failed to maintain habitable conditions
*   Retaliation or discrimination

### Right to Safe and Habitable Housing

Even during the eviction process, landlords must maintain the property in habitable condition. Tenants cannot be forced to live in dangerous or unhealthy conditions.

### Protection Against Retaliatory Eviction

Indiana law prohibits retaliatory eviction. Landlords cannot evict tenants in retaliation for:

*   Complaining about habitability issues
*   Reporting code violations to authorities
*   Joining a tenant organization
*   Exercising other legal rights

If eviction proceedings begin shortly after a tenant exercises protected rights, the tenant can raise retaliation as a defense.

### Right to Retrieve Belongings

After eviction, tenants have a right to retrieve their personal belongings. Indiana law requires landlords to:

*   Store tenant belongings for a reasonable period (typically 30 days)
*   Provide the tenant notice of how to reclaim belongings
*   Return belongings upon request (though landlord may charge reasonable storage fees)

## Common Eviction Mistakes Indiana Landlords Should Avoid

Evictions can go wrong quickly if proper procedures aren't followed. Here are the most common mistakes Indiana landlords make:

### Filing Too Quickly

Filing before the notice period expires will result in case dismissal. Make sure you wait the full 10 days (for rent nonpayment) or other applicable period before filing.

### Defective Notices

Notices that don't include required information, include improper demands (like late fees with rent), or aren't properly served will be invalid. Use clear, proper forms and document service.

### Accepting Partial Rent Payments

Accepting rent after serving a notice to pay or quit can waive your right to evict for that particular non-payment. If you accept payment, make it clear in writing whether this resolves the notice or not.

### Self-Help Evictions

Never change locks, remove belongings, or shut off utilities without a court order and writ of possession. These actions are illegal and can result in serious liability.

### Retaliatory Evictions

Don't evict tenants shortly after they complain about repairs, report code violations, or exercise legal rights. These evictions will likely be deemed retaliatory and dismissed.

### Not Documenting Everything

Lack of documentation is a primary reason landlords lose eviction cases. Keep records of:

*   Rent payment history
*   All notices served
*   Communication with the tenant
*   Property condition (photos/videos)
*   Receipts for repairs

## Frequently Asked Questions About Indiana Eviction Process

### Q1: How long does the eviction process take in Indiana?

A1: From start to finish, a typical eviction in Indiana takes 4-8 weeks. This includes the 10-day notice period, time to file and serve court papers, 2-4 weeks until the hearing, and time for the writ of possession and sheriff's removal. Contested cases with defenses can take longer.

### Q2: Can I evict a tenant in Indiana without going to court?

A2: No. Indiana law requires a court order before you can legally remove a tenant. Self-help evictions (changing locks, removing belongings, shutting off utilities) are illegal. You must go through the court process and obtain a writ of possession executed by the sheriff.

### Q3: What if the tenant pays rent after I've filed for eviction in Indiana?

A3: It depends. If the tenant pays all rent owed plus court costs before the hearing, you may be required to dismiss the eviction (unless your lease says otherwise). Once judgment is entered, accepting rent doesn't automatically stop the eviction. Consult with an attorney if this situation arises.

### Q4: Can I keep the entire security deposit if I evict a tenant for non-payment?

A4: Only if you follow proper procedures and have legitimate deductions. You can deduct unpaid rent, damages beyond normal wear and tear, and court costs (if awarded). But you must provide an itemized statement within 45 days and return any remaining balance. Simply evicting a tenant doesn't automatically forfeit their entire deposit.

### Q5: Do I need a lawyer to evict a tenant in Indiana?

A5: Not necessarily. Indiana allows landlords to represent themselves in eviction proceedings, especially in small claims court. However, if your case is complex, involves substantial money, or the tenant has an attorney, hiring a lawyer can be beneficial. Many landlords successfully handle straightforward evictions themselves.

## Conclusion: Navigating the Indiana Eviction Process Successfully

Understanding the **Indiana eviction process** is essential for Indiana landlords who need to regain possession of their property while protecting themselves legally. From serving proper 10-day notices to filing court papers, attending hearings, and executing writs of possession, every step must be followed precisely.

While Indiana's eviction laws are generally considered landlord-friendly, the process still requires attention to detail, proper documentation, and adherence to legal procedures. Self-help evictions and procedural shortcuts can result in case dismissal, liability, and significant delays.

For tenants, understanding your rights during the eviction process—including notice requirements, the right to a hearing, valid defenses, and security deposit protections under Indiana Code §32-31-3-12—empowers you to navigate what is often a difficult situation.
