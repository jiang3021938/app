Whether you own rental units in Des Moines, manage properties in Cedar Rapids, or are a tenant in Iowa City, knowing the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Iowa's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by the **Iowa Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Law**, codified in Iowa Code Chapter 562A (§§562A.1 through 562A.37). This comprehensive statute establishes the core rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants throughout the state.

This guide covers the most important aspects of Iowa landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. Whether you're a tenant seeking to understand your rights or a landlord working to maintain compliance, this article is your essential resource.

## Overview of Iowa's Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Law

The Iowa Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Law, found in Iowa Code Chapter 562A, provides a comprehensive framework for residential rental relationships. The Act applies to most residential rental agreements in Iowa, with limited exceptions for institutional housing and certain owner-occupied properties.

### Key Principles

The Act establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and habitable
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith throughout the tenancy
*   Lease agreements cannot waive the protections provided by the Act
*   Retaliatory actions by landlords are prohibited

## Iowa Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Iowa's security deposit rules are detailed in Iowa Code §562A.12.

### Security Deposit Limit: 2 Months' Rent Maximum

Under Iowa Code §562A.12(1), Iowa landlords may charge a security deposit of up to **two months' rent**. This is a hard cap that applies statewide.

For example, if the monthly rent is $1,200, the maximum security deposit is $2,400. This limit includes all refundable deposits collected at the start of the tenancy, regardless of how they are labeled (e.g., "pet deposit," "cleaning deposit").

### The 30-Day Return Rule

Under Iowa Code §562A.12(3), landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the rental agreement terminates. If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with a written **itemized statement** of deductions within the same 30-day period.

The 30-day period begins when:

*   The tenant surrenders possession of the rental unit
*   All keys are returned to the landlord
*   The rental agreement has terminated

The landlord must mail the deposit and statement to the tenant's last known address or forwarding address.

### Permitted Deductions

Iowa landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Cleaning costs** — To restore the unit to the condition at move-in, beyond normal wear and tear
4.  **Other lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches

Normal wear and tear — such as minor wall scuffs, small nail holes, gently worn carpet, and faded paint — cannot be deducted. Thorough documentation at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists is essential.

### Interest on Security Deposits

Iowa has a notable provision regarding interest. Under Iowa Code §562A.12(2), if a landlord holds a security deposit for **five or more years**, the landlord must pay the tenant **interest** on the deposit at a rate determined by the state treasurer.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 30 days, the tenant may recover the full deposit amount. Under Iowa Code §562A.12(7), a landlord who wrongfully withholds a deposit may be liable for up to **twice the amount wrongfully withheld**, plus court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Iowa

One of the most fundamental tenant protections under Iowa law is the right to a safe, habitable dwelling. Iowa Code §562A.15 outlines the landlord's maintenance obligations.

### Landlord Obligations Under §562A.15

Iowa landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, and other systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Provide adequate heat during winter months
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal
*   Maintain appliances supplied or required by the lease agreement

### Tenant Maintenance Responsibilities Under §562A.17

Iowa tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, or damage the property
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Allow the landlord reasonable access for repairs and inspections

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving written notice, tenants have several remedies under Iowa law:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

Under Iowa Code §562A.21, tenants must first provide written notice to the landlord describing the condition that requires repair. The landlord generally has **7 days** to remedy the condition for issues materially affecting health and safety.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

Under Iowa Code §562A.23, if the landlord fails to make essential repairs after proper notice, a tenant may contract for repairs and deduct the cost from rent. The repair cost may not exceed **$500 or one month's rent** (whichever is greater) per repair.

#### 3. Rent Abatement

If the landlord's failure to maintain habitability materially affects health and safety, the tenant may be entitled to a reduction in rent proportional to the diminished value of the rental unit.

#### 4. Lease Termination

If the landlord fails to remedy a material health or safety violation within the required timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement under §562A.21. The tenant must provide written notice of termination.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit for breach of the habitability warranty, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can Iowa Landlords Enter?

Iowa law balances the landlord's need to access the property with the tenant's right to privacy and quiet enjoyment.

### The 24-Hour Notice Requirement

Under Iowa Code §562A.19, landlords must provide at least **24 hours' notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Entry must occur at reasonable times.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services
*   Other purposes permitted by the lease agreement

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as:

*   Fire or imminent danger to persons or property
*   Burst pipes, gas leaks, or other urgent maintenance issues
*   Reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the premises

If a landlord repeatedly enters without proper notice, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief and may recover damages under §562A.19.

## Eviction Process in Iowa

Iowa's eviction procedures are governed by Iowa Code §562A.27 through §562A.29 and Iowa Code Chapter 648 (forcible entry and detainer). Landlords must follow these procedures precisely — failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Iowa landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Significant breaches of the lease agreement
3.  **Substantial damage to the property** — Willful or negligent destruction
4.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises, particularly drug-related offenses
5.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires without renewal
6.  **Clear and present danger** — Actions posing an immediate threat to health or safety

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper written notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **3-day notice** to pay or vacate (Iowa Code §562A.27(2))
*   **Material lease violation (curable)**: **7-day notice** to remedy; if not cured, the landlord must provide an additional **30-day notice** of termination (Iowa Code §562A.27(1))
*   **Repeated lease violations**: If the same violation recurs within **6 months**, the landlord may issue a **7-day unconditional notice** to vacate (Iowa Code §562A.27(1))
*   **Clear and present danger / drug activity**: **3-day unconditional notice** to vacate (Iowa Code §562A.27A)
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** (Iowa Code §562A.34)

### The Eviction Court Process (Forcible Entry and Detainer)

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the landlord can file a forcible entry and detainer (FED) action:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files an FED petition with the district court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the original notice and petition
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within a few days to two weeks
4.  **Trial**: Both parties present evidence
5.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Removal**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of removal, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Prohibited

Iowa law strictly prohibits self-help evictions under §562A.25A. Landlords cannot:

*   Change or remove locks
*   Shut off utilities (heat, water, electricity, gas)
*   Remove doors or windows
*   Remove tenant belongings without a court order

Violations can result in liability for actual damages plus up to **two months' periodic rent** and reasonable attorney's fees under §562A.26.

## Retaliation Protections Under §562A.36

Iowa Code §562A.36 protects tenants from retaliatory actions. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in retaliation for a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right granted by Chapter 562A
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

If retaliatory conduct occurs within **one year** of a protected activity, it is presumed retaliatory. The landlord bears the burden of proving a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the action.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Iowa

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Neither party is required to give notice of non-renewal unless the lease specifies otherwise. If the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement on the same terms.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before the end of a rental period under Iowa Code §562A.34.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or Chapter 562A
*   Domestic violence, sexual abuse, or stalking (Iowa Code §562A.27B provides specific protections)
*   Unit becomes uninhabitable due to casualty damage

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Iowa landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent under §562A.29(3).
