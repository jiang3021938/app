# Oregon Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Oregon Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/oregon-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Navigating **Oregon landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Beaver State. Whether you own rental units in Portland, manage properties in Eugene, or are a tenant in Salem, understanding the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Oregon's primary residential landlord-tenant statute is the **Oregon Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (ORLTA)**, codified in Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) Chapter 90. This act applies to most residential rental agreements and provides the baseline rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants throughout the state. Oregon is also notable for being one of the first states to enact statewide **rent control legislation** under SB 608 (2019), later amended by HB 2001 and subsequent bills.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of Oregon landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, rent control provisions, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities under Oregon law.

## Overview of the Oregon Residential Landlord and Tenant Act

The ORLTA, found in ORS Chapter 90, establishes one of the most comprehensive landlord-tenant frameworks in the nation. It applies to most residential rental agreements in the state, with limited exceptions for transient lodging, certain institutional housing, and occupancy under a rental agreement covering non-residential premises.

### Key Principles

The Act establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and habitable
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith throughout the tenancy
*   Lease agreements cannot waive the protections provided by the Act
*   Retaliatory actions by landlords are prohibited
*   Rent increases are regulated under Oregon's statewide rent control law

## Oregon's Rent Control Law (SB 608 / HB 2001)

Oregon made national headlines in 2019 when it became the first state in the nation to enact statewide rent control through **Senate Bill 608**. This law, subsequently amended by **HB 2001** and other legislation, places limits on how much landlords can increase rent.

### Rent Increase Caps

Under ORS §90.323, landlords may not increase rent during the first year of a tenancy. After the first year, rent increases are capped at **7% plus the Consumer Price Index (CPI)** over a 12-month period. The actual cap percentage is published annually by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services.

### Exemptions from Rent Control

The following properties are exempt from Oregon's rent increase cap:

*   **New construction** — Buildings with a certificate of occupancy issued within the last 15 years
*   **Subsidized housing** — Government-subsidized units with rent restrictions already in place
*   **Landlord-occupied duplexes** — Where the landlord lives in one unit

### Required Notice for Rent Increases

Under ORS §90.323(3), landlords must provide at least **90 days' written notice** before any rent increase takes effect. This applies regardless of the amount of the increase.

## Oregon Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Oregon's rules are outlined in ORS §90.300.

### No Statutory Limit on Deposit Amount

**Oregon does not impose a statutory limit on the amount a landlord can collect as a security deposit**. However, the deposit must be reasonable in relation to the rent and the condition of the premises. Starting in 2024, certain local jurisdictions in Oregon have implemented additional restrictions on move-in costs.

Under ORS §90.300(7), landlords who collect a last month's rent deposit must apply it to the last month's rent or return it according to the deposit return rules.

### The 31-Day Return Rule

Under ORS §90.300(1), landlords must return the security deposit within **31 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the tenancy has terminated. This 31-day window applies to the return of the deposit or the delivery of an itemized statement of deductions.

The 31-day period begins when:

*   The tenant has vacated the rental unit
*   The tenancy has been terminated
*   The landlord has the tenant's forwarding address (or sends the accounting to the last known address)

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with a **written accounting** detailing each deduction and the amount withheld.

### Permitted Deductions

Oregon landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Cleaning costs** — Costs to restore the unit to the same level of cleanliness as at the start of tenancy
4.  **Unpaid utilities** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease
5.  **Other amounts owed under the rental agreement** — Permitted charges specified in the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, and fading paint — cannot be deducted. Document the condition of the unit thoroughly at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized accounting within 31 days, the tenant may recover the full deposit amount. Under ORS §90.300(16), if the landlord acts in bad faith (e.g., knowingly providing a false accounting), the tenant may recover up to **twice the amount wrongfully withheld**.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Oregon

One of the most fundamental tenant protections under the ORLTA is the right to a safe, habitable dwelling. ORS §90.320 outlines the landlord's maintenance obligations.

### Landlord Obligations Under ORS §90.320

Oregon landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems and elevators in good working order
*   Provide running water and adequate hot water at all times
*   Provide functioning smoke detectors and carbon monoxide alarms
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal
*   Maintain weatherproofing, including windows, doors, and roof
*   Supply locks and keys for all exterior doors

### Tenant's Maintenance Responsibilities

Under ORS §90.325, tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage, rubbish, and other waste in a clean and safe manner
*   Use electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, damage, impair, or remove any part of the premises
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Conduct themselves in a manner that does not disturb other tenants' peaceful enjoyment
*   Not engage in drug-related or other illegal activity on the premises

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving written notice, tenants have several remedies under the ORLTA:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is always to notify the landlord in writing. Under ORS §90.365, the landlord generally has **seven days** to remedy the condition if it materially affects health and safety, or **30 days** for other conditions.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct

Under ORS §90.365, if the landlord fails to make essential repairs within the specified timeframe, the tenant may arrange for repairs and deduct the cost from rent. The repair cost may not exceed one month's rent per repair, and the tenant must provide receipts to the landlord.

#### 3. Rent Reduction

If a landlord's failure to maintain the premises substantially impairs the rental value of the unit, tenants may seek a rent reduction proportionate to the decrease in value.

#### 4. Termination of Lease

If the landlord fails to address a material health or safety violation within the required timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement under ORS §90.360. The tenant must provide written notice.

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit against the landlord for breach of the habitability warranty, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can Oregon Landlords Enter?

Oregon law carefully balances the landlord's need to access the property with the tenant's right to privacy.

### Notice Requirements Under ORS §90.322

Under the ORLTA, landlords must provide **24 hours' notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. Entry must occur at reasonable times during normal business hours.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs, decorations, alterations, or improvements
*   Supplying necessary or agreed-upon services
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, lenders, or contractors
*   During the last month of the tenancy for showing to prospective tenants (with consent or 24-hour notice)

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, gas leaks, burst pipes, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property. Landlords may also enter if they have reasonable cause to believe the tenant has abandoned the premises.

## Eviction Process in Oregon

Oregon's eviction procedures are governed by ORS Chapter 90 and related statutes. Oregon has some of the strongest tenant protections in the nation, including cause-based eviction requirements for most tenancies.

### Oregon's Cause-Based Eviction Requirements

Under Oregon law (effective since SB 608 in 2019), landlords generally cannot terminate a month-to-month tenancy without cause after the first year of occupancy. Valid causes for eviction include:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Breaches of significant lease terms
3.  **Criminal activity** — Drug-related or other serious criminal conduct
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires without renewal
5.  **Landlord's personal use** — The landlord or a qualifying family member intends to occupy the unit
6.  **Major renovation** — The landlord plans substantial renovations that require the unit to be vacant
7.  **Demolition or conversion** — The landlord intends to demolish the building or convert it to non-residential use

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **10-day notice** to pay or vacate (ORS §90.394), with a 4-day grace period after the notice expires
*   **Material lease violation (first offense)**: **14-day notice** to cure, with at least 14 days to remedy (ORS §90.392)
*   **Repeated lease violation**: **14-day notice** without opportunity to cure if the same violation has occurred within the past six months (ORS §90.392)
*   **Criminal activity or imminent danger**: **24-hour notice** to vacate (ORS §90.396)
*   **No-cause termination (first year only)**: **30-day notice** for month-to-month tenancies within the first year (ORS §90.427)
*   **Qualifying landlord reasons (after first year)**: **90-day notice** with one month's rent as relocation assistance (ORS §90.427)

### The Eviction Court Process

If the tenant does not comply with the notice, the landlord can file an action for possession (forcible entry and detainer) in circuit court:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a complaint for possession with the circuit court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **First Appearance**: The tenant has **7 days** to respond or appear
4.  **Trial**: If the tenant contests, a trial is scheduled within a short timeframe
5.  **Judgment**: The judge hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Execution**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a judgment of restitution, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

Oregon law strictly prohibits self-help evictions under ORS §90.375. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities (including water, gas, electricity, and heat)
*   Remove doors, windows, or other features
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant

Violations can result in liability for actual damages, plus up to **two months' periodic rent**, and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Retaliation Protections

ORS §90.385 protects tenants from retaliatory actions by landlords. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in response to a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right granted by the ORLTA
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association
*   Testifying against the landlord in a legal proceeding

If retaliatory action occurs within six months of a protected activity, the tenant may raise retaliation as a defense to eviction and may recover up to two months' rent in damages plus reasonable attorney's fees.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Oregon

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires at the end of the stated term. Under Oregon's cause-based eviction rules, if a fixed-term lease of one year or longer expires and the landlord does not intend to renew, the landlord must provide **90 days' written notice** and pay relocation assistance equal to one month's rent if the non-renewal is not based on tenant cause.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies during the first year of occupancy, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before termination. After the first year, landlords may only terminate with cause or qualifying landlord reason with **90 days' notice**.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or the ORLTA
*   Domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking situations (under ORS §90.453)
*   Uninhabitable conditions that the landlord refuses to remedy
*   Tenant who is 62 years of age or older entering a licensed care facility (ORS §90.275)

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent for up to **one and one-half months' rent** as a liquidated damages amount, or actual damages if specified in the lease, provided the landlord makes reasonable efforts to re-rent. Oregon landlords have a statutory duty to mitigate damages under ORS §90.415.
