# Hawaii Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Hawaii Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/hawaii-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Understanding **Hawaii landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Aloha State. Whether you own rental units in Honolulu, manage properties on Maui, or rent an apartment on the Big Island, Hawaii's comprehensive tenant protection framework requires careful attention to legal requirements.

Hawaii's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by the **Hawaii Residential Landlord-Tenant Code**, found in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 521 (§§521-1 through 521-82). This Code provides one of the more tenant-friendly legal frameworks in the country, with strong protections for renters and detailed requirements for property owners.

This guide covers the most important aspects of Hawaii landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules.

## Overview of the Hawaii Residential Landlord-Tenant Code

The Hawaii Residential Landlord-Tenant Code (HRS Chapter 521) establishes a comprehensive framework for residential rental relationships throughout the state. The Code applies to most residential rental agreements, including single-family homes, apartments, condominiums, and other dwelling units.

### Key Principles

The Code is built on several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide safe, habitable rental housing
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must act in good faith
*   Lease agreements cannot waive the protections provided by the Code
*   Retaliatory actions by landlords are prohibited
*   All evictions must go through the court system

Hawaii's unique geographic and economic characteristics — including high housing costs, limited land availability, and island-specific building challenges — make understanding these laws especially important for both landlords and tenants.

## Hawaii Security Deposit Law

Hawaii's security deposit rules are detailed in HRS §521-44.

### Security Deposit Limit: 1 Month's Rent Maximum

Under HRS §521-44(b), Hawaii landlords may charge a security deposit of no more than **one month's rent**. This is one of the strictest deposit caps in the country.

For example, if the monthly rent is $2,000, the maximum security deposit is $2,000. This limit applies to all refundable deposits collected at the start of the tenancy, regardless of how they are labeled.

Landlords may collect additional nonrefundable fees (such as a pet fee), but these must be clearly distinguished from the refundable security deposit and must be reasonable.

### The 14-Day Return Rule

Under HRS §521-44(c), landlords must return the security deposit within **14 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the landlord receives the tenant's forwarding address.

If the landlord intends to make deductions, they must provide the tenant with an **itemized list** of damages and the estimated or actual cost of repairs within the 14-day window. If actual costs are not yet available, the landlord must provide a good-faith estimate and follow up with actual costs within 30 days.

### Permitted Deductions

Hawaii landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Cleaning costs** — To restore the unit to the condition at move-in, minus normal wear
4.  **Other lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, faded paint — cannot be deducted.

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 14 days, the landlord may be liable for the full deposit amount plus damages. Courts may award the tenant up to **twice the security deposit amount** if the landlord acted in bad faith, plus court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

### Best Practices for Security Deposits

*   Conduct thorough move-in and move-out inspections with dated photos
*   Have the tenant sign a condition report at move-in and move-out
*   Keep deposits in a trust account (recommended practice)
*   Return deposits and itemized statements promptly within 14 days
*   Keep copies of all receipts, invoices, and documentation

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Hawaii

The right to habitable housing is a cornerstone of Hawaii's landlord-tenant law. HRS §521-42 outlines the landlord's comprehensive maintenance obligations.

### Landlord Obligations Under HRS §521-42

Hawaii landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems
*   Provide running water and a reasonable amount of hot water
*   Provide trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal
*   Maintain all appliances and facilities provided by the landlord
*   Exterminate insects, rodents, and other pests
*   Provide locks and keys for the rental unit
*   Maintain the roof, walls, and foundation in weatherproof condition

Given Hawaii's tropical climate, issues like moisture, mold, pest control, and hurricane preparedness are particularly relevant to habitability.

### Tenant Responsibilities Under HRS §521-51

Tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use all fixtures, appliances, and systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently damage the property
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord
*   Not disturb neighbors' peaceful enjoyment
*   Allow the landlord reasonable access for repairs and inspections

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain habitability after receiving proper notice, tenants have several remedies:

#### 1. Written Notice

Under HRS §521-63, the tenant must first provide written notice to the landlord describing the condition that needs repair. The landlord generally has a reasonable time to address the issue — typically **7 days** for health and safety issues, and up to **12 days** for less urgent matters.

#### 2. Repair and Deduct (HRS §521-64)

If the landlord fails to make essential repairs after proper written notice, the tenant may:

*   Contract for necessary repairs
*   Deduct the cost from the next month's rent
*   The deduction cannot exceed one month's rent
*   This remedy can be used only once per 12-month period

#### 3. Rent Withholding / Lease Termination (HRS §521-63)

For conditions that materially affect health and safety, the tenant may:

*   Terminate the rental agreement with proper notice
*   Seek a court order reducing or suspending rent until repairs are made

#### 4. Reporting to Authorities

Tenants can report code violations to local building and health departments. Landlords are prohibited from retaliating against tenants who file complaints.

## Entry Rights in Hawaii

### The 2-Day Notice Requirement

Under HRS §521-53, landlords must provide at least **two days' (48 hours') notice** before entering a rental unit, except in emergencies. The notice can be written or oral.

Entry must occur at reasonable times, typically between 8 AM and 6 PM.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services
*   Exhibiting the unit to prospective purchasers or mortgagees

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as:

*   Fire or imminent danger to persons or property
*   Burst pipes, gas leaks, or other urgent maintenance issues
*   Natural disasters (hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes)

If a landlord abuses the right of entry, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief and recover damages of up to one month's rent for each violation under HRS §521-53(c).

## Eviction Process in Hawaii

Hawaii's eviction process is governed by HRS §521-68 through §521-78 and HRS Chapter 666 (summary possession). The process provides significant tenant protections.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Hawaii landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Significant breaches of the lease agreement
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal drug activity or other serious criminal conduct
4.  **Nuisance** — Conduct that substantially interferes with other tenants' enjoyment
5.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires without renewal
6.  **Owner occupancy** — Landlord needs the unit for personal use (with proper notice)

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for summary possession, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **5 business days' notice** to pay or vacate (HRS §521-68)
*   **Material lease violation (curable)**: **10-day notice** to cure; if uncured, an additional **30-day notice** to vacate (HRS §521-72)
*   **Material lease violation (not curable)**: **5-day notice** for conduct that cannot be remedied
*   **Drug-related criminal activity**: **24-hour notice** in cases involving illegal drug activity (HRS §521-69(b))
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **45 days' written notice** (HRS §521-71) — note this is longer than many states
*   **Week-to-week tenancy termination**: **10 days' written notice**

### The Summary Possession Process

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the landlord files a summary possession action:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a complaint with the District Court
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 15–25 days
4.  **Trial**: Both parties present evidence and arguments
5.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
6.  **Writ of Possession**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of possession, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Strictly Prohibited

Hawaii law strictly prohibits self-help evictions under HRS §521-63(c). Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities (electricity, water, gas)
*   Remove the tenant's belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant
*   Block access to the rental unit

Violations can result in the tenant recovering actual damages, plus up to **two months' rent** as a penalty, and reasonable attorney's fees under HRS §521-63(c).

## Retaliation Protections Under HRS §521-74

Hawaii provides strong anti-retaliation protections. A landlord may not retaliate against a tenant by increasing rent, decreasing services, or threatening eviction for:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency or court
*   Organizing or joining a tenant association
*   Exercising any right under the Residential Landlord-Tenant Code
*   Testifying in any proceeding related to landlord conduct

If retaliatory conduct occurs within **six months** of a protected activity, it is presumed retaliatory. The landlord must prove a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the action.

## Lease Termination and Renewal

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires at the end of the stated term. If the tenant remains and the landlord accepts rent, the tenancy converts to a month-to-month arrangement under the same terms.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

Either party may terminate a month-to-month tenancy by providing at least **45 days' written notice** under HRS §521-71. This is longer than the 30-day notice required in most states.

### Week-to-Week Tenancies

For week-to-week tenancies, at least **10 days' written notice** is required.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or the Landlord-Tenant Code
*   Domestic violence (HRS §521-80 through §521-82 provides specific protections)
*   Uninhabitable conditions the landlord refuses to remedy
*   Natural disaster rendering the unit uninhabitable

Landlords have a statutory duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent when a tenant breaks a lease early.

### Rent Increases

Hawaii does not have statewide rent control, though certain local jurisdictions may have additional regulations. Landlords must provide at least **45 days' written notice** before increasing rent for month-to-month tenancies. Rent cannot be increased during a fixed-term lease unless the lease specifically allows it.
