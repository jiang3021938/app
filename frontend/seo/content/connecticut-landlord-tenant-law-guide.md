# Connecticut Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Connecticut Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/connecticut-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Understanding **Connecticut landlord-tenant law** is critical for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Constitution State. Whether you own rental units in Hartford, manage properties in New Haven, or rent an apartment in Stamford, Connecticut's robust tenant protection framework requires careful attention to legal requirements.

Connecticut's residential landlord-tenant relationships are governed primarily by **Connecticut General Statutes (CGS) Chapter 830, §§47a-1 through 47a-74**, which provides one of the most comprehensive landlord-tenant frameworks in the country. Connecticut is generally considered a tenant-friendly state, with strong protections for renters and detailed requirements for property owners.

This guide covers the most important aspects of Connecticut landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules.

## Overview of Connecticut's Landlord-Tenant Statutes

Connecticut General Statutes Chapter 830 (§47a) establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for residential rental relationships. The statutes cover everything from lease requirements to security deposits, habitability standards, and eviction procedures.

### Key Principles

Connecticut landlord-tenant law is built on several fundamental principles:

*   Strong tenant protections, including broad habitability rights
*   Strict security deposit handling requirements
*   Detailed eviction procedures with robust due process protections
*   Protection against retaliatory and discriminatory actions
*   Significant penalties for landlord non-compliance

Connecticut also has additional local ordinances in many municipalities that may impose further requirements on landlords. Always check local regulations in addition to state law.

## Connecticut Security Deposit Law

Connecticut's security deposit rules are among the most detailed in the country, found in CGS §47a-21.

### Security Deposit Limits

Connecticut imposes strict caps on security deposit amounts:

*   **General tenants**: Maximum of **2 months' rent**
*   **Tenants age 62 or older**: Maximum of **1 month's rent**

This distinction for senior tenants is an important feature of Connecticut law that landlords must track carefully. The age-based limit applies at the time the deposit is collected.

For example, if the monthly rent is $1,500:
*   A tenant under 62 can be charged up to $3,000
*   A tenant 62 or older can only be charged up to $1,500

### The 30-Day Return Rule

Under CGS §47a-21(d), landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the premises. If the landlord intends to make deductions, they must provide the tenant with an **itemized statement** of damages within that 30-day window.

The landlord must mail the deposit and statement to the tenant's last known address. If the tenant provides a forwarding address, it must be sent there.

### Interest on Security Deposits

A notable feature of Connecticut law is that landlords must pay **interest on security deposits**. Under CGS §47a-21(i), landlords must pay or credit interest on the deposit annually. The interest rate is set by the state Banking Commissioner. Failure to pay interest can result in penalties.

### Permitted Deductions

Connecticut landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Other lease violations** — Costs resulting from documented lease breaches

Normal wear and tear — minor wall scuffs, small nail holes, worn carpet, faded paint — cannot be deducted.

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

Connecticut imposes significant penalties on landlords who mishandle security deposits. Under CGS §47a-21(d), if a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 30 days, they may be liable for **double the security deposit amount** plus court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

This is one of the strongest deposit penalty provisions in the country, making compliance especially critical for Connecticut landlords.

### Escrow Requirements

Landlords must hold security deposits in an **escrow account** at a Connecticut bank. The account must be separate from the landlord's personal or business funds. The landlord must notify the tenant in writing of the name and address of the bank where the deposit is held.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Connecticut

Connecticut provides strong habitability protections for tenants under CGS §47a-7.

### Landlord Obligations Under CGS §47a-7

Connecticut landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain all electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems
*   Provide running water and a reasonable amount of hot water at all times
*   Provide reasonable heat during the heating season (October 1 through May 31)
*   Maintain appliances supplied by the landlord in good working order
*   Provide adequate trash receptacles and arrange for trash removal
*   Maintain all safety features, including smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors
*   Provide and maintain window screens (between April and November)

### Tenant Responsibilities Under CGS §47a-11

Tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use all fixtures and systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently damage the property
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Not disturb other tenants' peaceful enjoyment
*   Allow the landlord reasonable access for repairs

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

Connecticut provides tenants with several robust remedies when landlords fail to maintain habitability:

#### 1. Written Notice

The first step is always to provide written notice to the landlord describing the condition. Under CGS §47a-13, the landlord generally has **15 days** to make repairs after receiving written notice for non-emergency issues.

#### 2. Rent Escrow (CGS §47a-14a)

If the landlord fails to make necessary repairs after proper notice, tenants may petition the court to place rent in escrow. The court can order rent payments deposited with the court until repairs are completed. This is a powerful remedy unique to Connecticut.

#### 3. Repair and Deduct

In certain circumstances, tenants may make necessary repairs and deduct the cost from rent, though specific procedures must be followed.

#### 4. Lease Termination

If the landlord's failure to maintain habitability is material and affects health or safety, the tenant may terminate the lease after providing proper written notice.

#### 5. Reporting to Authorities

Tenants can report code violations to local building and health departments, which can order landlords to make repairs. Landlords are prohibited from retaliating against tenants who file such complaints.

## Entry Rights in Connecticut

### The Reasonable Notice Requirement

Under CGS §47a-16, landlords must provide **reasonable notice** before entering a rental unit. While the statute doesn't specify an exact timeframe, **24 hours** is generally considered reasonable.

Entry must occur at reasonable times, and the tenant must not unreasonably withhold consent.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Supplying agreed-upon services

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, flood, gas leaks, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property.

### Tenant's Right to Deny Entry

Connecticut tenants have the right to deny entry if the landlord fails to provide reasonable notice or attempts to enter at unreasonable times. However, tenants cannot unreasonably deny access for legitimate purposes.

## Eviction Process in Connecticut

Connecticut's eviction process is governed by CGS §47a-23 through §47a-42 and provides significant due process protections for tenants. The process is commonly known as a "summary process" action.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Connecticut landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Lapse of time** — Lease expiration
3.  **Material lease violations** — Significant breaches of the lease agreement
4.  **Nuisance** — Conduct that substantially disturbs other tenants or neighbors
5.  **Serious nuisance** — Drug dealing, prostitution, or other serious criminal activity
6.  **Owner occupancy** — Landlord intends to use the unit personally (limited circumstances)

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction (summary process), landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent**: **3-day notice** to quit (CGS §47a-23(a)) — this is one of the shortest in the country
*   **Lease violation (curable)**: **15-day notice** to cure, followed by additional notice to quit if uncured
*   **Lapse of time (lease expiration)**: **3-day notice** to quit
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **3-day notice** to quit (though providing longer notice is best practice)
*   **Serious nuisance**: **3-day notice** to quit (immediate for certain criminal activity)

### The Summary Process (Eviction Court)

Connecticut's eviction process involves several steps:

1.  **Notice to Quit**: Landlord serves the notice to quit (the notice period depends on the grounds)
2.  **Filing**: After the notice period expires, landlord files a summary process complaint with the Superior Court
3.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint at least **5 days** before the return date
4.  **Return Date**: The tenant must file an appearance with the court
5.  **Answer**: The tenant has **2 days** after the return date to file an answer
6.  **Mediation**: The court may offer or require mediation
7.  **Trial**: If no resolution, the court holds a hearing
8.  **Judgment**: The court issues a ruling
9.  **Execution**: If the landlord wins, a stay of execution may be granted (typically 5 days); then a state marshal can carry out the eviction

### Stay of Execution

Connecticut provides tenants with the ability to request a **stay of execution** (delay) after an eviction judgment. The court may grant a stay of up to 5 days (or longer in hardship cases), giving the tenant additional time to find alternative housing.

### Self-Help Evictions Are Strictly Prohibited

Connecticut law strictly prohibits self-help evictions. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant
*   Block access to the rental unit

Violations can result in significant liability, including actual damages, punitive damages, court costs, and attorney's fees under CGS §47a-46.

## Retaliation Protections Under CGS §47a-20

Connecticut provides strong anti-retaliation protections. A landlord may not retaliate against a tenant by increasing rent, decreasing services, or threatening eviction for:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Organizing or joining a tenant association
*   Exercising any right under the landlord-tenant statutes
*   Testifying in any proceeding related to landlord conduct

If retaliatory conduct occurs within **six months** of a protected activity, it is presumed retaliatory. The burden shifts to the landlord to prove a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the action.

## Lease Termination and Renewal

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires at the end of the stated term. If the tenant remains and the landlord accepts rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

Either party may terminate a month-to-month tenancy by providing a **3-day notice** to quit under CGS §47a-23. However, best practice is to provide **30 days' notice** or more to maintain good relations and allow adequate time for transition.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or habitability standards
*   Domestic violence (CGS §47a-11e provides specific protections for victims)
*   Early termination clause in the lease
*   Tenant is 62 or older and relocating to a nursing home or assisted living

Landlords have a statutory duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the unit when a tenant breaks a lease early.

### Rent Increases

Connecticut does not have statewide rent control, though some municipalities may have local rent stabilization ordinances. Landlords must provide proper notice before increasing rent — typically the notice period corresponds to the rental period (e.g., one rental period for month-to-month tenancies).
