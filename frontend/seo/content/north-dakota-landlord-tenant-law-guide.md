Navigating **North Dakota landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Peace Garden State. Whether you own rental units in Fargo, manage properties in Bismarck, or are a tenant in Grand Forks, understanding the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

North Dakota's primary residential landlord-tenant statutes are found in **North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) Chapter 47-16**, which governs the general landlord and tenant relationship, along with **Chapter 47-16.1**, the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA) provisions that some cities have adopted. These laws apply to most residential rental agreements and provide the baseline rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of North Dakota landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities under North Dakota law.

## Overview of North Dakota Landlord-Tenant Law

North Dakota's landlord-tenant framework is primarily found in NDCC Chapter 47-16. Unlike many states, North Dakota has not adopted a comprehensive statewide version of the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, though some municipalities have enacted local ordinances that supplement state law.

### Key Principles

North Dakota landlord-tenant law establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and fit for habitation
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must honor the terms of the lease agreement
*   Lease agreements must comply with state law requirements
*   Retaliatory evictions are disfavored under North Dakota case law

## North Dakota Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. North Dakota's rules are outlined in NDCC §47-16-07.1.

### Deposit Amount Limits

Under NDCC §47-16-07.1, **North Dakota generally limits security deposits to one month's rent**. However, a landlord may charge up to **two months' rent** if the tenant's credit history, rental history, or other factors present a higher risk to the landlord. The landlord must document the reason for the higher deposit.

Pet deposits may also be collected in addition to the standard security deposit, subject to reasonable limitations. These amounts are also governed by the security deposit return requirements.

### The 30-Day Return Rule

Under NDCC §47-16-07.1, landlords must return the security deposit within **30 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the lease has terminated. This 30-day window applies to the return of the deposit or the delivery of an itemized statement of deductions.

The 30-day period begins when:

*   The tenant has vacated the premises
*   The lease term has ended or been properly terminated
*   The landlord has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with an **itemized written statement** detailing each deduction and the amount withheld for each item.

### Permitted Deductions

North Dakota landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Breach of lease terms** — Costs resulting from lease violations
4.  **Cleaning costs** — If the unit was not left in a reasonably clean condition
5.  **Unpaid utilities** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, and fading paint — cannot be deducted. Document the condition of the unit thoroughly at move-in and move-out with dated photos and signed checklists.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 30 days, the tenant may be entitled to recover the full deposit amount. Under NDCC §47-16-07.1, if the landlord acts in bad faith, the tenant may also recover damages, and in some cases the landlord may be liable for treble damages and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in North Dakota

North Dakota recognizes the implied warranty of habitability, requiring landlords to provide and maintain rental units that are safe and fit for human habitation.

### Landlord Obligations Under NDCC §47-16-13.1

North Dakota landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, and ventilating systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide adequate heating facilities capable of maintaining a reasonable temperature
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Maintain the structural integrity of the building, including roofs, walls, and foundations

### Tenant's Maintenance Responsibilities

Under North Dakota law, tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, damage, or remove any part of the premises
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving notice, tenants have several remedies:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is always to notify the landlord in writing. The landlord should be given a reasonable time to remedy the condition, typically **14 days** for non-emergency conditions. For conditions that pose an imminent threat to health or safety, shorter notice may be appropriate.

#### 2. Rent Escrow

Under NDCC §47-16-13.2, if the landlord fails to make necessary repairs after reasonable notice, tenants in certain jurisdictions may petition the court to place rent in escrow until repairs are made.

#### 3. Termination of Lease

If the landlord fails to address a material health or safety violation within a reasonable timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement with written notice.

#### 4. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit against the landlord for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief.

## Entry Rights: When Can North Dakota Landlords Enter?

North Dakota law provides general guidelines on landlord entry, balancing the landlord's property rights with the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment.

### Reasonable Notice Requirement

While North Dakota does not specify a statutory number of hours for advance notice, landlords are generally expected to provide **reasonable notice** before entering a rental unit. In practice, most courts and legal practitioners consider **24 hours** to be reasonable notice.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants, buyers, or contractors
*   Addressing emergency situations
*   Other purposes agreed upon by both parties

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, gas leaks, burst pipes, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property. Landlords may also enter if they reasonably believe the tenant has abandoned the premises.

## Eviction Process in North Dakota

North Dakota's eviction procedures are governed by NDCC Chapter 33-06 and related statutes. Landlords must follow these procedures precisely; failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

North Dakota landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Breaches of significant lease terms
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal conduct on the premises
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
5.  **Health or safety violations** — Tenant actions that endanger the property or other tenants

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent or utilities**: The landlord must provide a written notice that allows the tenant an opportunity to pay within a set timeframe. Under North Dakota practice, a **3-day notice** to pay or vacate is standard for nonpayment
*   **Material lease violation**: Written notice giving the tenant an opportunity to cure, typically with at least **3 days' notice**
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **30 days' written notice** before the end of the rental period (NDCC §47-16-15)
*   **Year-to-year tenancy termination**: **Notice given at least one month before the end of the year** of the tenancy

### The Eviction Court Process

If the tenant does not comply with the notice, the landlord can file an eviction action in district court:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files an eviction summons and complaint with the district court and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint at least **3 days** before the hearing
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 3–15 days
4.  **Judgment**: The judge hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
5.  **Writ of Restitution**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of restitution, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

North Dakota law prohibits self-help evictions. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant

Violations can result in liability for actual damages plus additional penalties.

## Retaliation Protections

While North Dakota does not have a specific retaliation statute as comprehensive as some states, courts generally disfavor retaliatory evictions. A landlord should not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in response to a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any legal right
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

Tenants may raise retaliation as a defense to eviction if they can demonstrate the landlord's action was motivated by the tenant's exercise of a protected right.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in North Dakota

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Under NDCC §47-16-15, if the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month or year-to-year arrangement depending on how rent is paid.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **30 days' written notice** before termination under NDCC §47-16-15.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or habitability obligations
*   Domestic violence situations (under NDCC §47-16-17.1)
*   Uninhabitable conditions that the landlord refuses to remedy

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. North Dakota landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property.
