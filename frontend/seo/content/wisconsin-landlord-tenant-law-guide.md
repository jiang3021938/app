# Wisconsin Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026: Rights, Deposits & Eviction Rules

![Wisconsin Landlord-Tenant Law Guide 2026](/assets/wisconsin-landlord-tenant-law-guide-hero.webp)

Navigating **Wisconsin landlord-tenant law** is essential for anyone renting or managing residential property in the Badger State. Whether you own rental units in Milwaukee, manage properties in Madison, or are a tenant in Green Bay, understanding the legal framework that governs rental relationships will help you protect your rights and avoid costly disputes.

Wisconsin's primary residential landlord-tenant statutes are found in **Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 704** (Landlord and Tenant) and the administrative code **ATCP 134** (Residential Rental Practices), enforced by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. Together these laws provide comprehensive rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants.

This comprehensive guide covers the most important aspects of Wisconsin landlord-tenant law in 2026, including security deposit requirements, eviction procedures, habitability standards, repair obligations, and lease termination rules. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities under Wisconsin law.

## Overview of Wisconsin Landlord-Tenant Law

Wisconsin's landlord-tenant framework is built on two primary sources: **Chapter 704** of the Wisconsin Statutes and the administrative code **ATCP 134**. Chapter 704 addresses the general landlord-tenant relationship, while ATCP 134 provides detailed consumer protection rules governing rental practices, including security deposits, disclosures, and prohibited lease provisions.

### Key Principles

Wisconsin landlord-tenant law establishes several fundamental principles:

*   Landlords must provide rental units that are safe and fit for habitation
*   Tenants must maintain the premises in a reasonable condition
*   Both parties must honor the terms of the lease agreement
*   Lease agreements must comply with state law requirements and ATCP 134
*   Retaliatory evictions are prohibited under §704.45

## Wisconsin Security Deposit Law

Security deposits are among the most frequently disputed aspects of landlord-tenant relationships. Wisconsin's rules are detailed in ATCP 134.06 and Wisconsin Statutes §704.28.

### Deposit Amount Limits

**Wisconsin does not impose a statutory limit on security deposit amounts.** Landlords may charge whatever amount they deem appropriate. However, market competition and practical considerations typically keep deposits in the range of one to two months' rent.

Under ATCP 134.06, landlords must provide tenants with a **check-in sheet** at the start of the tenancy so the tenant can document the condition of the premises. This is a critical requirement unique to Wisconsin.

### The 21-Day Return Rule

Under ATCP 134.06(2), landlords must return the security deposit within **21 days** after the tenant vacates the premises and the lease has terminated. This 21-day window applies to the return of the deposit or the delivery of an itemized statement of deductions.

The 21-day period begins when:

*   The tenant has vacated the premises
*   The lease term has ended or been properly terminated
*   The landlord has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect

If the landlord intends to withhold any portion of the deposit, they must provide the tenant with a **written itemized statement** detailing each deduction and the amount withheld for each item within the 21-day period.

### Permitted Deductions

Wisconsin landlords may deduct from the security deposit for:

1.  **Unpaid rent** — Any rent owed through the end of the tenancy
2.  **Damage beyond normal wear and tear** — Costs to repair tenant-caused damage
3.  **Breach of lease terms** — Costs resulting from lease violations
4.  **Cleaning costs** — Only if the tenant did not leave the premises as clean as when they moved in
5.  **Unpaid utilities** — If the tenant was responsible under the lease

Normal wear and tear — minor scuffs on walls, small nail holes, worn carpet from ordinary use, and fading paint — cannot be deducted. The check-in sheet provided at move-in is critical evidence for determining whether damage exceeds normal wear and tear.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

If a landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 21 days, the tenant may be entitled to recover **double the amount wrongfully withheld** under ATCP 134.06(3)(a). The landlord may also be liable for reasonable attorney's fees. Wisconsin takes security deposit violations seriously, and the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection can pursue enforcement actions.

## Tenant Rights to Habitable Housing in Wisconsin

Wisconsin recognizes the implied warranty of habitability, requiring landlords to provide and maintain rental units that are safe and fit for human habitation.

### Landlord Obligations Under Wisconsin Law

Wisconsin landlords must:

*   Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes materially affecting health and safety
*   Make all repairs necessary to keep the premises in a reasonable state of repair under §704.07(2)
*   Keep common areas clean and safe
*   Maintain electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems in good and safe working order
*   Provide adequate heating facilities capable of maintaining a reasonable temperature
*   Provide running water and reasonable amounts of hot water
*   Maintain the structural integrity of the building, including roofs, walls, and foundations
*   Maintain smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors in working order

### Tenant's Maintenance Responsibilities

Under Wisconsin law and ATCP 134, tenants must:

*   Keep the premises clean and sanitary
*   Dispose of garbage and waste properly
*   Use electrical, plumbing, heating, and other systems reasonably
*   Not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, damage, or remove any part of the premises
*   Comply with applicable building and housing codes
*   Report maintenance issues promptly to the landlord

### Repair Remedies for Tenants

If a landlord fails to maintain the property in habitable condition after receiving notice, tenants have several remedies:

#### 1. Written Notice to the Landlord

The first step is always to notify the landlord in writing. The landlord should be given a reasonable time to remedy the condition. Under §704.07(4), the tenant must give the landlord notice and a reasonable opportunity to repair.

#### 2. Rent Abatement

If the landlord fails to make necessary repairs after proper notice, the tenant may be entitled to rent abatement proportional to the diminished value of the premises.

#### 3. Repair and Deduct

Under §704.07(4), Wisconsin tenants may arrange for necessary repairs and deduct the reasonable cost from rent (up to one month's rent) if the landlord fails to repair within a reasonable time after written notice. The tenant must give the landlord at least **14 days' written notice** before making repairs.

#### 4. Termination of Lease

If the landlord fails to address a material health or safety violation within a reasonable timeframe, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement under §704.07(4).

#### 5. Legal Action

Tenants can file a lawsuit against the landlord for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, seeking damages, rent abatement, or injunctive relief. The local code enforcement office or housing inspector can also be contacted.

## Entry Rights: When Can Wisconsin Landlords Enter?

Wisconsin law addresses landlord entry in ATCP 134.09, balancing the landlord's property rights with the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment.

### 12-Hour Notice Requirement

Under ATCP 134.09(2), landlords must provide at least **12 hours' advance notice** before entering a rental unit. This is shorter than many other states but still provides meaningful protection for tenant privacy.

### Permitted Reasons for Entry

Landlords may enter with proper notice for:

*   Making necessary or agreed-upon repairs
*   Inspecting the premises
*   Showing the property to prospective tenants or buyers
*   Performing routine maintenance
*   Other purposes agreed upon by both parties

Entry must occur at **reasonable times** unless the tenant consents to a specific time.

### Emergency Entry

Landlords may enter without notice in genuine emergencies, such as fire, gas leaks, burst pipes, or other situations involving imminent danger to persons or property. Landlords may also enter if they reasonably believe the tenant has abandoned the premises.

## Eviction Process in Wisconsin

Wisconsin's eviction procedures are governed by Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 799 (Small Claims) and §704.17. Landlords must follow these procedures precisely; failure to do so can result in the eviction being dismissed.

### Valid Grounds for Eviction

Wisconsin landlords can pursue eviction for:

1.  **Nonpayment of rent** — Failure to pay rent when due
2.  **Material lease violations** — Breaches of significant lease terms
3.  **Criminal activity** — Illegal drug activity on the premises under §704.17(2)(b)
4.  **Holding over** — Remaining after the lease term expires
5.  **Health or safety violations** — Tenant actions that endanger the property or other tenants

### Notice Requirements Before Eviction

Before filing for eviction, landlords must serve proper notice:

*   **Nonpayment of rent (month-to-month tenancy)**: A **5-day notice** to pay or vacate under §704.17(2)(a)
*   **Nonpayment of rent (fixed-term lease)**: A **5-day notice** to pay or vacate
*   **Material lease violation (month-to-month)**: **14-day notice** to cure or vacate under §704.17(2)(b)
*   **Material lease violation (fixed-term lease)**: **5-day notice** to cure, and if uncured, a **14-day** unconditional notice to vacate
*   **Month-to-month tenancy termination**: **28 days' written notice** under §704.19(3)
*   **Criminal activity**: **5-day unconditional notice** to vacate under §704.17(2)(b)

### The Eviction Court Process

If the tenant does not comply with the notice, the landlord can file an eviction action in small claims court:

1.  **Filing**: Landlord files a summons and complaint for eviction with the circuit court (small claims division) and pays the filing fee
2.  **Service**: The tenant is served with the summons and complaint at least **5 days** before the hearing
3.  **Hearing**: The court schedules a hearing, typically within 10–20 days
4.  **Judgment**: The judge or court commissioner hears evidence from both sides and issues a ruling
5.  **Writ of Restitution**: If the landlord prevails, the court issues a writ of restitution, and the sheriff can remove the tenant

### Self-Help Evictions Are Illegal

Wisconsin law prohibits self-help evictions under §704.11. Landlords cannot:

*   Change locks to exclude the tenant
*   Shut off utilities
*   Remove tenant belongings
*   Physically remove or intimidate the tenant

Violations can result in liability for actual damages, statutory damages, and reasonable attorney's fees.

## Retaliation Protections

Under Wisconsin Statutes §704.45, landlords are prohibited from retaliating against tenants for exercising their legal rights. A landlord may not increase rent, decrease services, or threaten eviction in response to a tenant:

*   Complaining about habitability issues or code violations
*   Filing a complaint with a government agency
*   Exercising any right under Wisconsin landlord-tenant law
*   Joining or organizing a tenant association

If a landlord takes adverse action in close temporal proximity to a tenant exercising a protected right, a rebuttable presumption of retaliation may arise.

## Lease Termination and Renewal in Wisconsin

### Fixed-Term Leases

A fixed-term lease expires automatically at the end of the stated term. Under §704.25, if the tenant remains after the lease expires and the landlord continues accepting rent, the tenancy typically converts to a month-to-month arrangement.

### Month-to-Month Tenancies

For month-to-month tenancies, either party must provide at least **28 days' written notice** before termination under §704.19(3). The notice must be given at least 28 days before the next rent due date.

### Early Termination

Tenants may terminate a lease early without penalty in certain situations:

*   Active military duty under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)
*   Landlord's material breach of the lease or habitability obligations
*   Domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking situations (under §704.16)
*   Uninhabitable conditions that the landlord refuses to remedy

Otherwise, tenants who break a lease early remain liable for rent until the landlord re-rents the unit or the lease term expires. Wisconsin landlords have a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-rent the property under §704.29.
